## Vessel’s origin

Built in Canada by TEK-composites and launched on July 5th 1998 under her original name “Northern Bounty”, she is the only TEK-45 (AKA Tektron 44) ever built.
This boat is a love child of TEK-35 and Tektron 50, both [John Shuttleworth](https://www.shuttleworthdesign.com)’s designs, and the latter being at one point one of the fastest multihulls in the world.
TEK-composites Inc. was a subsidiary of Tektron Equipment Corporation (formed in 1986), that specialized in manufacturing airplane and helicopter hulls, producing only 15 boats during its lifetime.
Those included first three legendary Manta catamarans, molds to which were later sold to American investors with Manta becoming US-made cats.

Originally purchased for $1M by three couples that took her on a one-year voyage, she ended up being a slip queen for over 20 years on the Gulf Coast of Florida near Saint James City.
After getting reposessed twice and going through many owners while remaining docked at the very same spot, she now belongs to yours truly as of March 2022.

She is a very spacious yet fast composite performance cruising catamaran.
It’s a shame a boat like this one wasn’t used at all in over two decades, she’s got a lot of life left in her and deserves much more than just sitting dead in the water.
But new adventures await her now, let’s see where the wind and current take her!

In October of 2022 Curious Cat was damaged in hurricane Ian.
In August of 2023 Curious Cat was damaged by a band of hurricane Idalia.

## Main goals of the project

- reverse-engineer and open-source the vessel
- repair and restore the vessel to her original glory (and better)
- be self-sufficient and operate solely on electric power
- promote use of titanium and other modern materials
- try out cutting-edge marine tech
