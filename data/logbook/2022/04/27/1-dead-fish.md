# Dead Fish

Found a dead fish laying on the dock this morning.
At first thought it jumped out of the water and was still alive, not having any idea which way to go.
But then its motionless body made it obvious the fish was completely dead.
I poured a couple of buckets of fresh water on it to push it back into the ocean without having to making any contact.
Maybe some hungry dolphin will eat it.

These fishes jump out of the water all the time here, even small ones do that.  No idea why though.  Not that it matters.

Iâ€™m no CSI, but my conclusion is that the fish jumped out and landed on the dock, then had a heart attack after seeing how big and beautiful my boat is.
