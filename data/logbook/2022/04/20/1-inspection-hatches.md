# Inspection hatches

Crawled into bow compartments, found two inspection hatches that lead to crash bulkheads in front of each of the hulls.
The hatches are not mounted properly, they’re glued to a circle of rubber that’s glued to the wall of that bulkhead, and the hole is smaller than the hatch itself.  Unless I’m not getting something obvious here, it’s another small thing that wasn’t properly done when the boat was constructed.  And the hatch on the starboard side was detached and simply laying next to the hole.

I’m thinking of either sealing those compartments completely, or buying new inspection hatches.  Really aiming at making that thing never leak even if the boat flips upside down — extra boyancy is so nice to have while you’re waiting to be rescued.

Oh, and the model is R205 by [RWO](https://rwo-marine.com), discontinued long ago.  I’m probably going to stick with plastic as well, just need to pick something really thick and sturdy.
