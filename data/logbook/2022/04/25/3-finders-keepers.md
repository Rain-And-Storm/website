# Finders keepers

Saw a rectangular plastic bag floating by at around 1800.
At first thought it was a newspaper, but then realized it’s 2022, people get their brains washed online.
Turned out to be a sealed package with three Orion distress smoke signals.
Took two sticks and pulled the bag up from the bow, it’s currently resting on my trampoline, drying.
Seems like a bit of salt water got inside the bag, but they could still be good.
