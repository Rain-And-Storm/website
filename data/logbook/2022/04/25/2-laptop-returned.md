# Laptop returned

Quit my job, the last day was Friday, had to send my laptop back.
Accidentally forgot half-finished bottle of water inside the box.
I think I’m getting old, but that’s alright.
Will be funny how they’re gonna open the package and find not just MacBook Pro in there, but also a small half-empty bottle of Aquafina.  I hope it doesn’t leak.
