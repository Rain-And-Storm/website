# USCG Documentation

Today my vessel was registered with USCG. Now I need to get documentation plaque and put new name and hailing port on my transom.

Primary vessel number: 1325176.

I didn’t like the original name so gave her a new one: Curious Cat.
Let’s see how many lives she’s got left.

My other naming options were:

 - Catanic
 - Catbus
 - Stimpy
 - Stifler’s Mom
 - Purr Some Sugar On Me
 - Stormy
 - Sunshine
 - Octocat
 - Kittana
 - Catharsis
 - Cataclysmic Apawcalypse
 - Purrfect Apawcalypse
 - Catfish
 - Purr Pressure
 - Fat Cat
 - Win-win
 - Catch-44
 - Purr Purr
 - Double Trouble
 - Cat Touch This
