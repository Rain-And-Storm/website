# Secret Treasure

While moving stuff around and cleaning up the boat, found another storage compartment.
It's full of all things kitchen: pans, pots, plates... was rather a nice surprise, considering the fact that I've been refitting and living on this
boat for about a month now.
Not sure I'll need any of that, since I have fancy Japanese and Italian cookware tucked away on Maui.
Can't wait to ditch it all at some thrift store and bring my stuff aboard.
