# Dave

Met a very cool guy named Dave today at a bar.  The dude is a badass engineer, builds and flies airplanes.  He's currently planning to build a fully electric one.
Told me about E-Z Poxy epoxy resin that's often used in building aircrafts.  It's supposedly stronger than what West System has, but much harder to mix and use, definitely not for novices like myself.  Maybe one day I'll get there, but for now I'm likely going to stick with West System.

He also gave me good advices for my project:
 1. Do one thing every day, even if it's small
 1. Only focus on most important things, non-crucial tasks can wait
 1. Only buy things that may become outdated (e.g. electronics) when you're ready to set the sail â€” all those gizmos becomes old fast

Told Dave about Ken, another airplane-building enthusiast from St. James City.  His eyes lit up right away, he gave me his card to pass it to Ken.  Ken owns [Golden Palm Resorts](https://www.goldenpalmswaterfrontresort.com) with his wife Julie, it's where I used to stay while my boat was still at [Bob & Annie's Boatyard](http://bobandannies.com).  They still let me use their washing machine and dryer even though I'm no longer a guest.
