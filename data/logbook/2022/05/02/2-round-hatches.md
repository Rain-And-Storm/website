# Round hatches

Those ten round hatches that were installed instead of leaky cabin windows about a decade ago, they turned out to be Jim Black,  More specifically, they are **592-20RND-05-02-05**.  20", but almost all stuck and leaking at this point.  The only good thing about them is that they’re tempered glass and not acrylic.  That can become a bad thing if I cut myself while removing them.

Trying to figure out what to replace them with.  Lewmar only makes acrylic round hatches, but if I put four square 70cm hatches
in the front to have a better view, then those will be definitely acrylic, and hence I could keep them all Lewmar without resorting to sketchy brands.  And I absolutely love how the boat looks from a side with those three round circles, I think there’s only one cat in the world that has that.  The front appearance I really hate, it looks like a retarded spider with those four round "eyes", not to mention you can barely see anything through them due to the angle.

Considering installing different sizes for the round ones.  It’s three on each side, that means I could make two of them 18", two 20", and two 22".  Need to do some drawing in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) to know if it’s a bad idea or not.  Whatever I get, I hope to be able to open them up more than 90 degrees — the current hatches say on them they can’t be opened more than 90 degrees, and that stinks.  Not that it matters, since they’re all stuck for good.

My other ideas include:
 - self-tinting layer or electric window tint
 - remote opening mechanism
 - mechanical shutter for round hatches (something like what analog cameras used to have)
 - OLED stickers that are see-through but emit light and hence light up the cabin when needed
 - [organic solar cells](https://infinitypv.com/products/opv/solar-tape) to make everything above require no wires

It’ll be nice to open all of them when I’m finally anchored in Hawaii, the airflow in the cabin is going to be absolutely sick!
