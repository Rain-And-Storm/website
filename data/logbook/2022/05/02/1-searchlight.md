# Searchlight

Traced two wires from the middle of the bow to my electrical panel.  I’m putting marked zip ties on wires to make better sense of what goes where, and eventually make everything nice and tidy.
The object of my interest today is Golight Radioray searchlight.

Used multimeter to find out if the voltage is there.  It is.
At first it seemed like the problem was in the lamp, but then I realized that the thing only has two wires, ergo needs to be controlled from somewhere else, remotely.  Found the remote inside the charting table.  Had to buy two A23 batteries to make it work.  Haven’t seen those in forever, forgot they’re 12V.  So small yet so powerful.  Reminded me of those tiny female anime characters that kick ass non-stop yet refuse to die.

I was able to turn the searchlight on, but the light from the halogen lamp was extremely dim, the thing was emitting constant clicking noise, and there was no way to turn it off or change its angle via the remote once it was on.  I believe it’s been there since day one — means over 20 years.  Maybe over 10 years, but still, it’s a long time for something that’s claiming to be "weatherproof"... it’s not even IP65.

Dismounted, disassembled.  Inside it had one and a half PCBs, two DC motors, lots of dead spiders, and some dirt.  I don’t expect those motors to work, most likely they’re dead, and I want them to be.

If I decide that I do need to have a searchlight for some reason, I’m probably going to buy a cheap waterproof LED spotlight that can recharge from the sun, and then add a couple of servos and a remote to it, potentially slap a camera on top.  This way it won’t require any wires and be as waterproof as I’ll be able to make it with my 3D printer.  New LED Golight products cost close to $700, and I don’t expect them to last — having seen what’s on the inside and how many gaps it has for dirt and salt water to enter.  Their products likely work better for cabins and offroad vehicles.
