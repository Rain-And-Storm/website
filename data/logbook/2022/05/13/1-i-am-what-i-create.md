# I am what I create

Original owner of the land where I’m renting the dock came by today with her son.
Very nice people, glad I got to meet Val.
I felt bad my I couldn’t invite them to check it out — my boat is right now a real mess on the inside.  But who isn’t.
Lots of splinters, saw dust, and trash bags full of whatever I’m not interested keeping.

It was nice of her to ask permission to pass my contact info to the new owners; they’re willing to continue renting the dock out to me.
No wonder, it’s $44/day of passive income, who would say "no" to that.

Her son runs the restaurant.
He had a really cool tattoo on his right arm — a purple square with "I am what I create" written in Hebrew.
