# Ken

Ken gave me two blades to try with my oscillating tool to remove those ugly wooden planks that are glued all over my boat on the inside.  One didn't fit my Ryobi tool, and the other one could work, but it seems like it'll take much longer when compared to using convential wood-cutting blades.

I'm most likely going to either use masking tape to protect the hull while I'm stripping my hull off those stupid wooden planks, or use the dull blade that Ken gave me as a protection layer, giving some elevation to the blade as well.  [Here](https://genesispowertools.com/wp-content/uploads/GMT15A_OM.pdf) it says,
> It is suggested that you have a piece of scrap material supporting the blade when making a flush cut. If you need to rest the blade on a delicate surface, you need to use cardboard or masking tape to protect the surface.

I'll try to see if I could use some kind of dissolver to get rid of the rest of the glue, or just sand it down.  Lots of work either way, but that's good.
