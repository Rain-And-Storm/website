# Northern Composites

Reached out to [Northern Composites](https://northerncomposites.com) today.  It’s a company that I was referred to by a contact at [SGS](https://www.sgs.com) when I asked for help regarding identifying materials that were used to build the hull of my vessel.
It’s obviously mostly kevlar, but the resin type is not clear.  Since the boat was reposessed twice (so far), the blueprints and all other info is missing.  SGS will help me with gas/mass spectrometry to see if it’s vinyl ester or really epoxy resin.  But NC are hopefully going to be there to help me with everything else (choice of materials for repairs, and just answer small questions here and there).
