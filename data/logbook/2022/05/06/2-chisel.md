# Chisel

Ordered a set of Japanese chisels off Amazon today.
Becase using my oscillating tool to remove all the wooden planks is going to take months.
It's ridiculous that I have to use a chisel and hammer on a composite boat, but I'm not the one who glued those wooden planks there to hold ugly dusty lining that has mostly disintegrated after over two decades under UV.
