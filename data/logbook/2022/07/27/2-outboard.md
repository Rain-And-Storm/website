# Outboard

Got back my 9.9hp Yamaha outboard from the boatyard.  Why not 10? — probably to stay under some regulations.  The boatyard didn’t have time to fix it, supposedly it has problems.  It’s not light, at least 60 lbs.  Carrying that bad boy for quarter of a mile wasn’t too fun, but I needed a good exercise.

Is it two-stroke, is it four?  Does it work at all?  Does it need oil?  Can I sell it for parts?  Many questions, no answers.  It’s over 20 years old, was probably used only a couple of times, and it’s made in Japan.  The sacrificial anode is dead, and I’m not sure if it’s because it wasn’t rinsed after its last use or because it was used too many times and nobody ever bothered to replace it.

I can’t express how much I hate internal combustion engines, but it’s a nice challenge and could teach me something.  As long as it doesn’t cost me a finger, that is.  If I fix it, it could be a good ego boost, and let me have some pocket change after selling it.  I’m getting an electric motor for my dinghy, can’t stand the smell of gasoline — one of the reasons I chose salt life.
