# Stern light

Finally managed to hook up my stern light — that’s a USCG requirement and a sure way to make other people see you at night when moving or at anchor.  One more little victory.

I started working on it right after getting the boat, just took me a long time to figure out which wires belonged to it.  First I’ve MacGyvered new stern light out of two — [one that I bought on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IA7PGHW/), and old one that was there when I bought the boat.  That old one had its plastic window eaten by the UV to the point that it looked opaque — ended up being just solid gray piece of plastic that once was transparent... pretty wild.  Twenty years of direct sunlight can do a lot of damage.  Wear your sunscreen, kids!

To this moment I have no idea how those wires go from my port’s stern to the breakout box, but it wasn’t too hard to recognize them.  It’s a white two-prong cable with 14 AWG cables inside — red and black, probably doesn’t need to be that thick, will likely replace it with something thinner, if that’ll make sense... but that’s when I get a new stern light, this one honestly looks very and very ghetto.

It’s nice to have visibility at night, the product description claims the light should be visible from 2 nautical miles after all.  The downside is that it’s one more thing that will attract fish and bugs.  Maybe I should put a horizontal plate of sorts underneath it so it’d still be visible to boats but not sea monsters?
