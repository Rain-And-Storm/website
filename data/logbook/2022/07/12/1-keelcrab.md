# Keelcrab

The tide was high this afternoon, so I gave my Keelcrab a try.

Installed metal brushes to get rid of barnacles, connected everything up, and the thing chooched!
My cat's hull is extremely round, so it was very hard to keep the crab "glued" to it, but I've managed to clean part of my port hull.  Wish the water here was less muddy, instead more clear and blue like in Hawaii â€” it's really hard to see where that little robot is, and even its camera can't see far in that nasty brown water.

Later it turned out that I removed some kind of foam flotation devices from Keelcrab because I, of course, didn't read the fucking manual and thought those were there to prevent something from breaking during transportation.  In my defense, they looked ghetto af.  I'll put them back in and give it another try sometime soon.
