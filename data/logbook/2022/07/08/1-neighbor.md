# Neighbor

Starting yestreday evening, have got a neighbor.  I love neighbors, neighbors are awesome!

The dock is long enough for my 44' cat and his 30' fishing boat to be docked with a pretty wide gap in between.
The guy is from Florida, a bit younger than me, also lives on his boat while fixing her up.  He bought that boat from his uncle, so it has sentimental value to him.  He told me that in Cape Coral there’re laws against staying at the same spot for more than a month, and people are usually dicks about sailors living on their boats there, so St James City is the place to be for boaters like us.  His powerboat has two mercruiser gasoline engines, and today it costs nearly $2000 to fill the tank up — he wishes he had just one diesel engine instead.  I gave him empty jerry can with funnel that I had left from my 10hp gasoline outboard that came with the catamaran, he’ll need it more than I do.
