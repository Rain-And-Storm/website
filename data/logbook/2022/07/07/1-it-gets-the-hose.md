# It gets the hose

Finally got a water hose to clean the exterior and refill my boat’s fresh water tank.  After a bit of research I landed on [this bad boy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083PQFW62).  Seems to be safe enough to drink from, and weighs less than 4 lbs.  Has to be drained after each use and kept away from sunlight, which I’m more than happy to do.  My second choice was Dramm ColorStorm, but that thing is super heavy, and not easy to toss around and move over your boat.

Some say cats don’t like water, but Curious Cat just loved being washed, we had so much fun today!  The nozzle that came in the box does magic.  In jet mode it’s strong enough to chip off old Awlgrip — the paint job was made over the previous layer, which is not exactly holding up great a decade later.  I’m planning to sand and repaint the whole exterior anyway, hence not sorry seeing that ugly old paint go.  The jet is so strong that it actually damaged some of the sheets that were covered in dirt.  They were likely already heavily damaged by UV, so no surprise in them being so brittle.  Not gonna miss them either.  Lastly, that jet was able to help me finally clean clogged drains in the cockpit.  Magic is real.

Refilling the water tank without having to carry heavy bucket from 50 ft away is a game changer, should’ve gotten a hose the moment I bought the boat, it’s really a must-have.
