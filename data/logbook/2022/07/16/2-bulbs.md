# Bulbs

I have lots and lots of wires hanging off my boat’s ceilings.  The ugly old lining that used to hold them in place is gone, so now they’re... well, hanging in there.  I’ll eventually replace all that fire hazard with flat 12V wires and OLED lights, but until then it is what it is.

Some of them are missing bulbs, and since LED lights seem to be neither expensive nor hard to find, it’s worth improving the current situation so that I could work in certain areas of the boat when it’s dark outside.  It should also help prevent getting burns by accidentally touching one of those wonders of modern technology.  Besides I have no idea what kind of fumes the casing may be emitting when the lamp heats up — rather keep all those mysteries to a minimum.

LEDs usually have a lot of UV and blue light emitted besides what us humans have evolved to be comfortable with, so it’s not entirely an upgrade, but should work well for the time being.

## Let’s dive in.

The current lamps I have installed are 32mm long and have pins 4mm apart, that’s likely the famous G4 socket.  The diameter is about 7mm accompanied by the base getting as wide as 8mm.  I keep seeing warm white lights for sale, and don’t necessarily need them to be dimmable, so so far so good, just need to find something bright and small enough to fit into those round housings and not touch the reflectors.  I’ll need 7 bulbs for each hull and 9 for the cabin, that’s... 23 in total.

Found [this beauty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09MHJ7RNN/).  Seems to fit into my lamps, 4000K is neither too yellow nor too blue, and they’re slightly above $1 a piece.  Will get 30 just in case they don’t do well in the marine environment or are made you know where.  These claim to be 320 lumens, that ought to be enough for anybody.  I could splurge and go with [these 350 lumen babes](https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/miniature-and-subminiature-bulbs/g4-led-landscape-light-bulb-35w-equivalent-bi-pin-led-disc-350-lumens/2698/), but would be a bit dumb paying almost six times more for extra 30 lumens for something I want to replace ASAP with OLED lights anyway.
