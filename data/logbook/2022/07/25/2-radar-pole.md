# Radar pole

There’s a tall aluminum radar pole located on starboard side, it holds GPS antenna and Raytheon radar.  Both are not in use and more than two decades old, besides I want to have my new B&G radar to be placed on the mast.  Once the Raytheon radar is gone, I plan to use this pole for wind generator.  From aluminum I’ll switch to carbon fiber.  Then I want to take down the existing air generator pole from the port side and mirror the exact same base and carbon pole for my second wind turbine on that side, too, to make it symmetrical.

That pole has caused me a lot of trouble — mostly due to rain getting caught between the hull and the pole, and dripping into my aft compartment where autopilot and black water tank are.  It was a design flaw, so I’ve solved it for now by wrapping that aluminum pole with [white polyethylene barrier tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08174678F/), that should prevent any moisture from accumulating at its base.
