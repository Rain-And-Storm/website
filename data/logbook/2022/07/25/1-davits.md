# Davits

Used acetone to wipe old paint off the davit system.  The process mostly felt like wiping dust — the UV has made the white paint disintegrate completely.

That whole contraption is aluminum — no idea what grade though.  There's a pretty thick layer of zinc chromate underneath the paint that was used as anti-corrosion barrier, and I have to say it's done its job.  I'd like to sand and repaint the whole thing a little bit later, but for now it no longer stains my skin and clothes on contact, and will serve as a good holder for my tender.
