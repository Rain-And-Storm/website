# Battens

Jim was passing by my boat again today, we chatted for a bit.

Turned out that those long fiberglass planks in my cabin that say "Tektron 44" on them are mainsail battens.  Mystery solved.

He’s recommended coating them in epoxy to make them slide in and out more easily.  I’ll probably do just that.
At least one of them is very good at giving me splinters, so that’s another reason for epoxying right there.
