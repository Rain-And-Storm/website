# Let there be light

Received and installed those nifty little G4 320-lumen LED bulbs today.  They are brighter than the ancient incandescent bulbs I had before, and my boat no longer looks like it’s low on batteries when the lights are on.  I’m able to work in the areas where I couldn’t see jack shit before, so that’s definitely a huge improvement.

They do seem to blind me more when looked at directly, but it’s a small price to pay for having more visibility inside the boat.  Another downside is they seem to be attracting bugs more than the old ones... but as long as I keep flyscreens in place, I should be fine.

It’s nice to see how instantly these go in and out.  They also don’t heat up nearly as much as those old ones the boat came with.
