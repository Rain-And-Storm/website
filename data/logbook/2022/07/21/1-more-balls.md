# More balls

Turns out that my mast has a 22mm battcar system by Harken.  Perhaps that’s what that Harken reballing kit I found aboard was for, one of the previous owners must’ve gotten a 10mm (3/8") ball kit instead of 6.5mm (1/4") by mistake.  Or maybe they tried to reball my mainsheet Lewmar traveler using that Harken kit?  The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.

Ordered a 1/4" Harken reball kit, it comes with Torlon® balls included, hence seems like a somewhat good deal.  I only need to reball one Harken car on my mast, nothing else.  Mostly curious about the process and how those little things work; it’s the bottommost car anyway — barely moves when the sail goes up, if at all.
