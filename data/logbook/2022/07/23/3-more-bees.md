# More bees

Found a little hive underneath one of storage hatches in the bow area.  At least they didn’t get inside the compartment itself — those hatch seals seem to be doing their job!  One guy escaped right away while mom and dad stuck around to raise next generation of brats.  Zapper, Dyson cordless vac — poof, whole family’s gone!  Lone survivor.

## Lone survivor

Could be another bee, or the one that have gotten away, but found it trying to master the art of sailing exploring rope clutch on my mast.  Zap’n’vac!  The zapper I have is only 3000V, and the larger the beast, the sooner it comes back to life.  Hope they won’t hive inside of my vacuum cleaner’s chamber.  I yet have to figure out how to kill them when they’re inside — just making them spin roughens them up a little, but doesn’t exactly kill.  Flying insects are overall really tough dudes.  Not to be fucked with, but can’t let them live rent-free on my boat, sorry nature.

It’s absolutely paramount for everything to be sealed.  If an insect can get in, it will.
