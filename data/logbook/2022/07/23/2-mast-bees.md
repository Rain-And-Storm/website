# Mast bees

It appears I have a bunch of wasp hives at the top of my mast.  Sometimes wasps wander into my boat.  The smart ones realize their mistake and promptly find their way out, the not so smart end up getting zapped and then go feed the fishes.  Would explain the enthusiasm local woodpeckers have for pecking my mast.

I’m glad the wasps are living in there, I want them to have fun flying out to check the breeze and not being able to find their favorite tree when I sail to Tampa.  Imagine the surprise when your favorite tree ends up sailing away from you.  Hope that never happens to me — I don’t know how to fly.  But that’s what harnesses are for.
