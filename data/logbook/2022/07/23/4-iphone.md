# iPhone

On my way back from The Waterfront restaurant found an iPhone with cracked back panel laying in the grass next to the road.  Picked it up, the front seemed to be fine.  Good.  Brought it home, put tape on cameras and fingerprint sensor, charged it up, it showed up home screen with a ton of missed calls.  I called "Dad", a guy picked up the phone, I said I found this phone laying on the road and would like to return it.  Will give it back to the family tomorrow.  It’s their daughter’s, they must’ve lost it a day or two ago on the way from their houseboat.  Maybe I’ll be able to rent their dock in case my current plan to anchor not far from here falls through.

The phone is not locked with any sort of passcode or fingerprint/face ID.  I’ve way too much pride to go through their texts, photos, and browsing history, but somebody else would.  And that somebody could be a real evil pedo, finding an iPhone of a 13 year old girl is many men’s wet dream.  No joke.
