# The chain

Pulled out my main anchor's chain.  Appears to be 42' long, rusted through and through.  Need to replace that treasure before I decide to drop the anchor somewhere.  The rest of that rode seems to be dyneema or some other synthetic rope.  It's old but doesn't appear to be damaged, no need to replace that one yet.

Chain links appear to be 5cm long, 3cm wide, and 1cm in diameter.  I hope it's possible to get stainless chain today, this one isn't looking good at all, but then again there's no anchor washdown pump in place, so that might've contributed to its poor condition.

I do have a small bruce style anchor, but no idea how well that will hold me in place, especially during the hurricane season.  Also, pulling those things out by hand is no fun.
