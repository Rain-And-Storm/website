# Dinghy

I urgenty need a dinghy for my cat.  There are many options for RIBs: Zodiac, West Marine, Mercury, Inmar, Neport Vessels, and many-many more.  Truth being told, it’s going to be a temporary tender until I get unsinkable carbon ZeroJet OC300, OCTenders OC300, or Aeolos AP10.  Those are all custom made to order and take forever to arrive.  Ergo have to buy something I don’t really want to have, but rather have to have.  Going to go with Zodiac just because I want to have a known brand in order to sell her faster later this year.

$1300 is the rough price for the smallest aluminum bottom zody.  I hate soft bottoms.  A bit later I’ll get a tiny electric outboard, but for now oars should do just fine — good workout!
