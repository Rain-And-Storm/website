# Crashboxes

The storage compartment on the starboard side has inspection port missing, and I don’t like that a single bit.  There’s basically a round 12cm hole that leads from that storage compartment into the crashbox.  Thankfully the crashbox has no water inside, but it has to be closed ASAP.  I’ll find something light yet waterproof and install them on both port and starboard sides.

The wall itself is honeycomb, about 35mm thick with all the paint and stuff.  I’ll find something nice to make it a real inspection port.  Will use silica bags to absorb all the moisture inside of those crashboxes.  Hope to never ever need to touch those inspection ports again after that.

For the time being I’ve put [white polyethylene barrier tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08174678F/) over that hole to make sure nothing crawls in and dies in there.

As for good news, the bow crossbeam seems to be made either out of carbon or aramid-carbon fiber — something black with traces of greenish yellow.  What a nice surprise!
