# Not the same deal

When I moved my boat here almost four months ago, I had privacy and could enjoy peace and quiet most of the time, relax and work on my boat.  I also rented the dock, not part of the dock.  For almost two weeks now I’ve been having a neighbor who lives on his 30’ fishing boat docked in front of mine, which is pretty much feels like having a roommate.  I’m still paying the same $44/day ($1/foot/day) as back when the whole dock was mine.  You could even say I rented the whole lot including this dock, because there is still nothing on it besides a couple of cameras.

The first mistake I’ve made, is that it’s not a marina, and I offered price per foot to the original owner.  This must’ve given the wrong impression that I rented only part of the dock, not the whole dock, and that it’s okay to stuff in as many boats as it fits here to just run a tiny marina and make boaters pay the mortgage.  Smooth move, but at this point I honestly feel like I’m being taken advantage of, and it’s not fair at all, since here’s what’s new:

1. Lack of privacy
2. A ton of stuff (chairs, lamps, buckets with trash, grills, etc) located on the dock
3. Constantly-running pump from that boat’s A/C
4. Automatic bright light that shines in your face and blinds you when you enter the dock
5. Smell of weed, sometimes vape
6. Loud music, mostly Eminem but sometimes some kind of autotune hip-hop
7. Gasoline engine that gets run weekly in front of my boat
8. Smell of grilled food
9. A ton of cockroaches that constantly get into my boat, likely get attracted by food and trash located on that fishing boat
10. The guy likes to fish, which is fine, but dead bait floating in the water and him hitting my boat with his fishing rod is a really big WTF
11. Having a car parked in the way is also a bit selfish, it really doesn’t need to be in other people’s way

The bottom line is, it is my fault that I’ve overstayed in St. James City.  I have my motors now, so nothing quite as large and heavy is going to be shipped to me.  I’m still waiting for my nke electronics and autopilot, but that can be delivered anywhere for approximately the same price, and transported to my catamaran on a tender.  I’m not mad at the new guy either, he’s just living his life, and I’m happy for him.  There’s too much to even try to comment, and he’s not being deliberately disrespectful.

I bought my boat to not be affected by other people’s lifestyles.  It also hurts to see people who you were kind to just assume you have low standards and try to put you in the corner while charging the same amount without asking if they could add more boats to the dock.  It’s my fault, again, since I gave them the idea to be able to rent this dock out for boats, I just, once again, didn’t expect to still be here by now.

I need to make my solar setup work ASAP, fix nav lights, and get a dinghy.  $308/week for this dock is over $1200/month, and for under $2000 I can get electric outboard motor, for $1300 I should be able to get a cheap RIB, about $150 to tow me to the nearest spot where I could anchor (unless I’m able to move properly on one prop myself).  No more cockroaches, loud music, or paying somebody for parking.  Later this year when I get myself a proper unsinkable dinghy, this one I should be able to sell for about $2000 with the motor, $800 without.
I really need something almost throwaway, just to stop paying rent for the dock that was once great.

I could say something like "it’s me or this guy", "not the same deal as before, we need to re-negotiate the deal", or even fall to that cheeky level and play into the greediness proposing something like "since it’s by the foot and not the whole dock, I’m gonna move my boat to only occupy less than half of its length, pay you for how many feet that is, and that’ll let you put 3rd boat here".  The truth is, the music is gonna be here, the cockroaches, weed, constantly running water from the pump — it’s all not going to go away.  But I think I should just vote with my money, by simply getting the dinghy and departing ASAP.  Every crisis is an opportunity, and I really shouldn’t be paying anybody for being anywhere — that was the whole idea behind my salt life.  It’s time to go, and I’m thankful for the unpleasant situation I’m currently in for it’s a good kick in the butt to get back on the path of chasing my dreams.

Hard lessons learned:
 - when renting dock from the owner, don’t ever rent it based on the length of your boat, rent the whole thing and clearly state your intention to do so
 - keep your yap shut about marinas being full, how expensive they are, and how there’s a demand for private docks
