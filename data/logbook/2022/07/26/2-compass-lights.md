# Compass lights

Traced and connected two wires for my compasses’ backlight — green and white(red stripe).

There’re two Ritchie compasses on Curious Cat, one per helm.  They have built-in backlight, or if you can count very dim tiny LED as one.  I hope there’s a way to adjust something and make them brighter.  They might be intentionally dim by design, not to be mistaken for navigation lights, since they’re lime-green.  I’d like to have something brighter, perhaps with built-in photodiode to toggle and adjust its backlight automatically.

There’s currently no switch in the circuit, they’re always-on.  I’ll connect them later to a breaker — there doesn’t seem to be any fuses in the circuit after all.

The compass on my starboard side seems to be either older or just way more damaged by the UV; even with backlight on I can’t see anything at night on that one.
