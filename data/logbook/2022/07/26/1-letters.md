# Letters

I need to take down "NORTHERN BOUNTY / VANCOUVER CANADA" and put "CURIOUS CAT / LAHAINA HAWAII" on my boat’s stern.  It’s part of that whole USCG compliance shebang that also includes vessel registration number placard, having documents onboard, and a couple other things.

The transom area is 24cm (9.5") tall, davits’ legs hug that area around the center and hence I have to place my vessel’s name and hailing port either inside the space of 100cm (39.5"), right underneath the davit system, or put "CURIOUS CAT" on port side, to the left of davits, and "LAHAINA HAWAII" to the right, on starboard.  Need to check USCG requirements for that.  Currently the vessel and home port names are located in the center, so hopefully letters don’t have to be too big to satisfy the requirements and will fit in there.

[This guide](https://www.boatus.com/products-and-services/boat-lettering/uscg-requirements) states that my letters must be at least 4" inches tall (10.16cm), _"can be on the transom or either side of the vessel"_, _"there is no requirement for block letters or any other restrictions to type, font, or color for federally documented vessels"_ — that one last is good, I should be able to use font that looks either very round (to match curves of my beautiful chunky cat), or go for pixel font, something like one of my favorites, Visitor TT2 — to match QR Codes that I plan on slapping on the sides of my boat.
Also, this is a bit worrying yet nice at the same time, _"When dinghy’s are stored on the swim platform or transom causing the vessel’s name and hailing port to be obscured from view, there is no Federal requirement to place the name and hailing port elsewhere. That is a Law Enforcement issue only"_.

Overall all good news, everything will fit under the davits and as long as I keep the dinghy lifted high enough, it shouldn’t cause any issues.
