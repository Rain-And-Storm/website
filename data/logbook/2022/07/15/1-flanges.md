# Flanges

My E-Tech motors came with beefy rigid couplings.  They’re not stainless but very well made.

I’m having a very bad feeling attaching 50kg motors to my 30mm prop shafts using those.  Long story short is I feel that using something like [Combiflex by Vetus](https://webshop.vetus.com/en/product/comfl1330-flexible-coupling) instead would allow me to reduce noise and vibration, plus prevent subtle movements of my motors from possibly bending the shaft, damaging shaft bearings, or wearing out its own internals.  The motors are going to be mounted on antivibration engine mountings that will let them swing a little bit.  It only makes sense to use flexible couplings here, my cat is a sailboat after all.

The prop shaft is 30mm in diameter, the motor’s shaft is 35mm with 8mm key.  I’ll have to design and custom-manufacture flanges that go along with those Combiflex couplings, but once that’s done the connection will be as close to perfect as it can be.
