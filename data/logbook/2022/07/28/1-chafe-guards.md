# Chafe guards

My [chafe guards by Osculati](https://sailormall.net/woolen-chafe-guard-for-rope-o-14-22-mm-black-code-06-315-01/) for docking lines have finally arrived.  Turned out to be two per package, so I now have four in total.  I like them, they’re fuzzy and now my docking lines no longer make annoying screeching sound whenever there’s tension during tide change.
