# Clean cat

Using my hose and dinghy, I was able to get to the starboard side, clean it, and finally remove that ugly "Northern Bounty" sticker from it.  She’s now a cat with no name.

The boat looks way less homeless now, and I know that new fenders that I’ll put on her won’t get any kind of dirt on them right away.

The most fun part was using my hose as water jet to push my Zodiac back to the starboard, I finally had some kind of propulsion system working here.  And of course there’s nothing as exciting as standing on two feet on an 8’ PVC inflatable tender holding a razor, trying to stay close to the boat while scratching that sticker off the hull.
