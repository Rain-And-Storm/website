# Clean cat

Using my hose and dinghy, I was able to get to the starboard side, clean it, and finally remove that ugly "Northern Bounty" sticker.  She’s now a cat with no name.

The boat looks way less homeless now, plus now I know that new fenders that I’ll put on her soon won’t get dirty right away.

The most fun part was using my hose as a water jet to push the Zodiac back to the boat.  Finally I had some kind of propulsion system working here.  And of course there’s nothing as exciting as standing on two feet on an 8’ PVC inflatable tender holding a razor, trying to stay close to the boat while scratching that sticker off the hull.
