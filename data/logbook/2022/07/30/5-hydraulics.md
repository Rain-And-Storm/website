# Hydraulics

Had a video consultation with Derek from [Captineer](http://www.captineer.com), his conclusion is that installing the motors while they’re in the water is a bad idea in my case due to the need for perfect alignment which is hard to get with the shafts being in place.  That complicates and delays my electrification quite a bit, but that’s alright, I’ll use my diesel and hydraulics for now, at least I’m not dead in the water.  Once I’m in Tampa, I’ll be able to fish her out and do what I need to do.  E-Tech guys will also be in Tampa in September, so even if my boat won’t have their motors in by then, they could advise me on how to properly mount them.

Ken and Julie from [Golden Palms](https://www.goldenpalmswaterfrontresort.com) (where I used to stay before transferring to my liveaboard) have offered some help.  Julie is just one of those cool down-to-earth free-spirited Americans, and Ken is this badass MacGyver type of a guy who builds and flies airplanes and used to be a diesel mechanic at some point.  She said they likely could help me make my port-side screw turn.  If it works out, I’ll be able to navigate myself out of here through the canal without bumping into anyone.
