# Cabin hatches

Some of my ten round hatches that represent cabin windows turned out not to be glued shut.  My guess is that the rubber gasket started leaking in some of them, and since those can’t be bought anymore today, someone decided to use black silicone and just glue them for good.  Either way, that means anybody can enter the boat even when the main sliding door is locked, which I’m not entirely cool with.  I need to get some black 5200 or similar and solve this situation once and for all.  Alternatively, I will design and 3D-print hatch locks that can’t be opened from outside.

I’m becoming a real boater now — hesitating to do permanent modification to parts of the vessel that I want to replace later anyway, and these ones I could sell on eBay to someone who needs spare parts or complete replacement of the whole thing.  The window itself is fine, it’s tempered glass, so there’s not a scratch on them and they look crystal clear.  I hope I don’t become like one of those hoarders with a ton of useless garbage sitting on their boat.
