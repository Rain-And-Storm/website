# USCG documentation

Turned out to be that documentation for my vessel won't be mailed for at least four more weeks.  Another thing to delaying me, but it's okay, it's all part of it.

Long story short is that the USCG have changed their forms at the end of April, and my paperwork was submitted right before then, so they had to re-fill and re-submit everything.  Bad ~~timing~~ luck.  Despite my boat being in the registry, I have no papers on hand that prove that I own the vessel, ergo unlikely to be able to pass through the Panama Canal until I get my papers together, but we'll see.

Will likely have to ask UPS to forward me those papers from Hawaii to wherever I'm gonna be at in 4+ weeks.
