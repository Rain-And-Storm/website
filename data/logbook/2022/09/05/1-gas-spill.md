# Gas spill

Was about to take a nap around 4pm, when a sudden smell of gasoline entered my boat.
The first thing I always assume is that it’s my tank or one of the canisters leaking, but that has never been the case so far.

I got out, the smell outside was even worse.
Then I saw a small power boat on a lift in front of me, running its bilge pump and leaking
either a ton of gas or mix of water and gas from its bilge.  The owner was next to it, an older guy, in his 70s or 80s.
I yelled and said he seems to be leaking something into the water.
Explained that I’m not going to tell anyone, but he may get into a very serious trouble for it.
He tried to bullshit me saying that there might be some oil in his bilge.
The smell of gas was almost unbearable at that point.
I said he might want to do this on land if there’s oil or gas in his bilge, then he turned off his bilge pump.
At that point the film on the water was larger than the size of my boat, it was flowing towards my catamaran.
One spark and my boat could be sitting in a pool of flame because of that idiot.

A guy named Sam who stays here at Golden Palms, said something very wise to me regarding what happened,
that many old people just don’t give a fuck after a certain point.
It makes a lot of sense, especially if they have no kids and **especially** if they were told
they have less than 4 years left to live by their overpaid doctor.
