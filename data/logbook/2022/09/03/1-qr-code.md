# QR code

One of the ideas I’ve had since early on when I bought this catamaran is to have two QR codes slapped on the sides of Curious Cat instead of writing her name there.  This way I could avoid a lot of questions about the vessel from seemingly friendly randos, so people could just find all the answers for themselves by pointing their favorite portable surveillance device at it.

Now I need to find a company that prints marine-grade vinyl stickers out of SVGs, but first need to generate that baby.  Doing so locally could be done, but why torture your OS when you can just go online and generate one?  [qrd°by](https://qrd.by/qr-code-generator-svg) was one of the top search results, so I went with that service.  The contents of my QR code is `https://svcuriouscat.com`.  The error correction level I went with is `M` (up to 15% of the code can be damaged or covered with dirt).  `Q` and `H` promise up to 25% and 30% respectively, but they seem to generate way smaller modules that may be harder to read from a far, and `L` is only 7% with the same exact module size as `M`... so `M` it is.

Of course when I saved that SVG to disk and opened in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), each module (black square) was a separate path, hence you could see teeny-tiny gaps between them — not Feng Shui.  Since my boat is going to be even more white in color than she is currently, I removed the background level completely, and then selected all those black paths that represent the QR code, and then did Path → Union.  Now the gaps are gone, and this QR code should look perfect when printed on vinyl and applied to the hull.  Leveling shouldn’t be too hard as I have a rub rail there, and besides could also just measure distance from the waterline by hanging something off my lifeline — there are ways of not messing it up.
