# Mosquitoes

Today I had a ton of mosquitos in my boat, never seen that many before.  Had to hunt them down with my zapper.

It appears that those gasoline vapors from yesterdayâ€™s spill woke them up and forced them into my boat.
I had to leave Curious Cat open yesterday for a few hours to let all those vapors air out.

Gosh I hate boomers.
