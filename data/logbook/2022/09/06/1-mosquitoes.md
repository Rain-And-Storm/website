# Mosquitoes

Today I had a ton of mosquitos in my boat, never seen that many before.
Had to hunt them down with my [zapper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09Y8SHPRY/).

It appears that those gasoline vapors from yesterday’s spill woke them up and forced them into my boat.
I had to leave Curious Cat open for a few hours to let all those vapors air out.
Gosh I hate boomers.

Been told by neighbor who’s renting month-to-month here at [Golden Palms](https://www.goldenpalmswaterfrontresort.com)
that [The Bug Juice](https://www.thebugjuice.com) is the stuff I need in case I encounter bugs here in Florida or while going
through the Panama Canal.  No unedible ingredients in it, seems to be non-carcinogenic.
I hope it works against black flies as well if I do go around Alaska.
