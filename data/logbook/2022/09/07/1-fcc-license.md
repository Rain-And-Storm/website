# FCC license

Got a sweet email from FCC today, said that my electronic license is ready.

Took them only a few days, very nice!

| FCC Call Sign | Station Identity/MMSI | Expiration Date |
|:--------------|:---------------------:|:---------------:|
| WDN3903       |       368276130       |    09-07-2032   |

Looks like that one-time fee is really more like once-in-a-decade fee.
But I’m honestly not too sure FCC is still going to be around in ten years from now, so maybe won’t have to pay it again.

Now I need to install my AIS hardware and input that MMSI in it.
Also, update the beacon department (or whatever their name is) and give them my FCC call sign and MMSI — didn’t have those yet
when I filled out and mailed them the form.
Oh, how I wish it was **PURR** or **MEOW**, but **WDN3903** is also very catchy.  Not.
