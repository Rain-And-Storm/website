# Impeller

Checked impeller on the diesel, seems to be fine, doesn’t require replacement.

Almost certain the lid on the housing wasn’t properly put on the last time it got changed — the zone where the impeller gets squished was in a different spot on the lid.  Put it where it belongs.

If something can be messed up by somebody else on this vessel, it usually is.  Not trying to say I’m an expert or a lifelong sailor, it’s just some stuff is very silly and obviously done wrong, often not even related to sailing.  But bit-by-bit she’s getting that TLC she wanted to have for so long.
