# Battens

Long story short, there’s like seven of them, and somebody before me decided to put a nasty black tape with disgusting gray glue around them, for whatever reason.

I cannot express how much I hate electrical/plumbing tape — it’s sticky, usually smells bad, and it always takes lots of nasty liquid of sorts to remove the glue residue completely.  The battens are fiberglass, covered in epoxy, hence can’t use acetone on them, only denaturated alcohol, and even that isn’t too good for them.  My Ryobi heat gun helps, but what the fuck, why not just use velcro or zip ties instead, why?

Each batten now has three spots that need to be carefully scraped, heated, wiped with paper towel, and then wiped with denaturated alcohol.  Oh, and they do leave splinters when covered in epoxy, just way less.  Fun.

It’s printed "SAILBONE", "CANADA", "-LUFF->", "NORTH SAILS" on them.

Well, good news, I have all the battens for my mainsail, even if one of them needs TLC.  No idea what theat 8th batten is there for, the ugly duckling that can give you splinters by just looking at it.  Unless there supposed to be eight in total, and T8 got destroyed in some kind of terrible sailing accident, with that substituting for it.

Most (if not all) of the glue is off now.  Boating seems to be a lot like this — one dude does something quick and weird, and then someone else has to waste hours, days, or weeks undoing whatever the fuck that was.
