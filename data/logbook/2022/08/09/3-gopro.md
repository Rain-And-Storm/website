# GoPro

My [GoPro Hero 10](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero10-black/CHDHX-101-master.html?option-id=CHDRB-101-master) is here!  This means I’m very close to starting my YouTube channel and becoming like one of those people.

The feature I’m already missing is that it doesn’t support wireless charging.  With salt everywhere here including the air, it might give up the ghots sooner than expected, but I’ll do my best to only open it when far away from moisture.  I might be able to add wireless charging to it, we’ll see.

Attached a [floating strap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B1GRPDG) to it, will test tomorrow to see if it’s enough to keep it afloat.
