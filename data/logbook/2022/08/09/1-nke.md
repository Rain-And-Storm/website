My autopilot and other gizmos from [nke](https://nke-marine-electronics.com) have arrived!

After first shipment of $12K worth of electronics got lost (courtesy of FedEX), 4 months after the day I ordered them, they’re finally here.  I obviously got very unlucky.  Plus they were shipped via freight, not air mail.  And didn’t go directly to me but went through one of the only distributors in the US.

Supposedly they have the best set of instruments and autopilot.  I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference since it’s my first marine autopilot and my first boat, but the feature that really caught my attention is their little remote control that you wear around your neck while sailing, and if you fall off the boat, it’ll point the vessel into the wind, effectively slowing it down enough for you to swim to it and not die alone in the open ocean.  Might come in handy.
