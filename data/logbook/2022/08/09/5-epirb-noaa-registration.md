# EPIRB NOAA registration

My [GPS emergency beacon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0108LN426/) got registered with NOAA today.  I’ll email them my AIS MMSI when I have it, so they could update their records to have that there as well.  Should probably also give them address of this website.

They’ve mailed me some kind of sticker that I’m supposed to physically put on the EPIRB itself.  I won’t be back in Hawaii for at least three more months.  My documents for the boat will likely also be shipped to my mailbox in there.  I’ll basically need to forward mail from Maui to myself somewhere on the mainland in order to go through Panama Canal.  That sticker should be in there along with my federal documentation thingy.
