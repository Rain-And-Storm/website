# Gecko

Something moved up the wall and scared the living shit out of me.  Turned out to be a tiny gecko.  I love lizards and snakes, so he’s absolutely welcome to stay.  As a captain of this vessel I’m responsible for everyone, including this mysterious passenger.  Too bad I don’t have a PFD of his size, but I think he knows how to swim.  He better.

He refused to eat a dead mosquito, don’t have anything else to offer him.  He’s very young and skinny, probably not even a year old.  They live long, over a decade or something like that.  Hope not to step on him by accident, he seems like a chill little guy.

Will for now hide that bug zagger so it doesn’t kill him, geckos may be attracted to light just like bugs, don’t need his cold blood on my hands.

Probably got in while I was sealing those hatches, or maybe been here for weeks if not months, eating little bugs.
