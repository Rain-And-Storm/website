# Stanless steel nuts for lifelines

Installed new [5/16"-24 stainless steel nuts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009EE9ROS).  It’s for my lifelines, four pelican locks located on the bow side, more specifically.  There were only two bolts when I bought the boat, and those were a bit rusty and had no markings of steel grade on them.  So, now they’re all 316 and at least come from the same factory.  I wish them to live a long and prosperous life and stay shiny.

I sometimes think I should slowly replace all metal with aluminum and titanium, but both those metals look like shit, never shine, and in general bend or break easier than stainless steel.  That 60% weight reduction on metal parts is sweet though.
