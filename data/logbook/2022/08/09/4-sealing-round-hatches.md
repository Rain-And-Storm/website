# Sealing round hatches

Four out of ten round hatches in my cabin weren’t glued shut, so I had to get them prepared with acetone and then sealed using [black 5200](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R0GUZG).  Their locks are old and broken, and I’m not comfortable having a boat that’s easy to get into, so decided to convert them into windows.  This Saturday, before departing, I’ll remove those handles to give larger and clearer field of view from the cabin.  It makes the boat look more polished somehow.

[Ryobi’s power caulk gun](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P8HTC3Q) really helped, turned out to be a very good tool!  I used the lowest speed, but the moment you lose angle or slip even just a little, the neat string of whatever substance it’s exrcreting messes up the target surface and you basically have to use it like a stick to kinda sorta undo the damage and make things a little bit more even.  I think I did well.  Well enough for a project boat that’s slowly turning into a real amazing catamaran she once was.  I’m gonna ditch those round hatches for something larger and prettier anyway.

Will sleep in a different state room for a couple of days, those fumes of curing 5200 seem not be too good for you.  That thing takes at least five days to set, but after that — bound forever.
