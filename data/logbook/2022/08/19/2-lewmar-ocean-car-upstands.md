# Lewmar Ocean track car upstands

Installed three shiny white cubes for my mainsheet traveler car.  No idea what they’re for, but those were missing, so felt like I had to put the thing back together.  I think they’re supposed to hold sheets attached to the boom or something like that...  will figure out later.
