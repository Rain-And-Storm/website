# MMSI

In order to get my AIS working in international waters, I’ll need to obtain MMSI through FCC.  One YouTube video outlined this process:

1. Obtain restricted radio phone operator’s permit — $0, never expires
1. Go to apps.fcc.gov/...
1. Register to get FCC account, you’ll get an FCC registration number (FRN)
1. Click on wireless.fcc.gov/..., enter your FRN number and password
1. "Apply for new license", select "SA or SB - ship"
1. File the application
1. Sign the application (first + last name), click submit

Sounds easy enough, hope to be done with it shortly.
