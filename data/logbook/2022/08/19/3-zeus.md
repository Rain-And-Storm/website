# Zeus

My 16" Zeus Glass Helm is here.  Will probably install inside at first, use Bluetooth and my tablet to access charts from outside.  It’s $7000, I’m not too comfortable putting that thing outside yet, maybe will do so later.  Cutting a giant hole for it is also not something I’m dying to do.
