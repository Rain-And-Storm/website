# Diver

Found a local diver to clean the bottom and check my props.  Name's Weston.  Chill guy, looks like a fireman — tall, porn stache, red hair.  Local to Pine Island, originally from Hawaii.  Gave me Kamaʻāina, so thanks for that.  But no matter what, it's not cheap — not an easy job to do, she's not been cleaned for at least 6 months.

Said my starboard prop seems to have way more growth on it than the other one... which makes sense, I could barely see any effect from running power to that side five days ago.  Hope we won't have to take them off, that'd be a real nightmare.

Took some videos from the dock, asked him to film if he finds anything interesting.  Maybe will make a video later for my channel.
