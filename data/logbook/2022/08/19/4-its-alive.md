# It’s alive!

After the diver was done, I fired up the engine and was able to move the boat forward and back, it finally managed to stir some mud in the water behind.  Might still have some problems with hydraulics and coolant, but this should be enough for me to get out of Saint James City and head to where I could paint and hopefully haul her out.  There’s a ton of electronics that I need to install on this baby.

Bumped into Jim not far from here, he was cheerful today, recommended me to be wary of other people’s lifts and power cables that run under water in the canal because of those.  Said that in salt water you can feel the electric current a little bit before it hits you, but in fresh water you don’t feel it until it does.  He said it might be a good idea to buy an electric snorkel mask with like 30' hose on it, to be able to clean the boat myself when I’m back in Hawaii.  That guy is a like a walking encyclopedia, I always learn something new whenever I bump into him.
