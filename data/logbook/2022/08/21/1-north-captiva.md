# North Captiva

Got invited to go along with a bunch of friends to North Captiva on a 27’ power catamaran.  Helped me get a better idea of what’s gonna be in my way when I take Curious Cat out of Dawson Canal the rest of the way.

Many areas around here have less than 4’ of depth, a couple of spots are only 2’ deep in high tide — all that makes it extremely hard for my cat with almost 4’ of draft to find her way out into the ocean.  I’m likely going to Charlestown, SC next, to avoid storms and get some place to dock and continue working on my boat, but first need to get out of Florida.

My friends gave me a tour of the island on their awesome little golf cart.  North Captiva is a very interesting place, there’re almost no gasoline cars in there, 99% of vehicles are golf carts.  There’s a landing strip for small personal aircrafts, and basically lots of rich folks own houses there that they rent out to yuppies.  That’s also the downside of the place, the crowd is extremely transitory, young, loaded with their parents’ money, and usually drunk.  On the bright side, lots of beautiful houses and exceptionally clean air.  The only way to get there is by plane or boat, and they get groceries delivered to them by boats, trash is taken out on a small barge.  Tons of gopher turtles, I picked one small guy up, it started hissing at me, I put it back down, and then I fed it some leaves, very lovely little animals.

About a hundred years ago a big storm has split that island into North Captiva and Captiva, basically washed away huge part of land.  Very unique place, too bad it’s very shallow around it, not for big boats.
