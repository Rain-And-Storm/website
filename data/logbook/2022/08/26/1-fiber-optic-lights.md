# Fiber optic lights

Reached out to [Lopolight](https://www.lopolight.com) regarding possibility of using fiber optics instead of copper.  The main advantages should be weight reduction as well as ease of maintenance, especially of the masthead light.  Less copper to carry lightning strikes down to my sailboat’s electronics, too.

They said they can’t help me with that project, that’s just not something they do.  But was happy to learn that they’re all sailors and the name "Lo po" comes from “low power” — they specialize in lightweight and low-power lights for vessels.  They did refer me to [RSL Fiber Systems](http://rslfibersystems.com) though, which seem to be specializing in proividing fiber optics-based lights for marine vessels, specifically US NAVY’s Zumwalt ships.  Hooyah!

RSL have informed me that their illuminator (light source) costs $50K and weighs whopping 75 lbs — a bit of an overkill for any sailboat.  But they’re working on a sub-$1000 model that’s about 6–9 months away, and if it’s small and light enough and doesn’t consume a whole lot of energy, could be what I’m looking for.  Using the same light source for my spreader lights and underwater lights could make a significant difference in the amount of copper my boat will carry, as well as make thru-hulls for underwater lights much smaller.

[This article](https://www.fiberplusinc.com/services-offered/benefits-fiber-optic-cables/) states that,

> Fiber cables are much thinner and lighter than copper wires. A fiber cable can weigh about four pounds per 1000 feet, compared to copper wires, which can weigh 39 pounds per 1000 ft. The lightweight fiber optics then require less space for functionality.

No idea if it’s accounting for two wires or just one, but pretty neat either way, 10 or 20 times lighter.  I think it’s for two copper wires vs. one fiber cable, since it mentions “fiber cable” and “copper wires”.  But ten times lighter, wow.
