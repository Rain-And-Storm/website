# Fenders with titanium rings

I’m trying to have as little stainless steel on my boat as possible.  Cleaning it is little to no fun, and even 316 tends to be generally weaker than grade 5 or even grade 2 titanium.

Called [AERE Docking Solutions](https://aeredockingsolutions.com) yesterday, they got back to me today confirming that rings on their fenders are stainless steel.  It might be possible to either do a custom order for fenders with titanium rings, or buy the usual ones they sell, cut those rings off, and then replace with carabines of sorts from [Allied Titanium](https://www.alliedtitanium.com).  Getting something custom signed with "Curious Cat" might be better though, no way to steal those rings if they’re not detachable, and if the fenders are personalized, nobody will try to steal those as well (I think).
