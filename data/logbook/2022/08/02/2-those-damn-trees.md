# Those damn trees

Used [Lee County Property Appraiser](https://leepa.org) to find who could cut those trees that extend into the canal and could scratch my hull or grab my mast as I go through it.

No, this is backwards... first I left a message via web form on Lee County’s website, then called them to ask how long it’ll take to get it done.  Lee County’s DOT said they are not responsible for Dawson Canal, and redirected me to the dept of natural resources.  There, I was told that owners of those properties that have trees growing on them are responsible for cutting them, and that’s how I was referred to that LEEPA website.

Boats can be forced to move using something called "Lee County code enforcement" (+1 239 533 8895), in case if they take up more than 25% of the width of the canal.  Which of course all those boats blocking the way do, but half of them don’t have working engines, owner of one of them won’t be back for like a week, and one guy cooks meth on his boat, which makes coordinating this whole project not exactly very straightforward.

I went to one of the properties across the canal and talked to a lovely gentelman, his wife, and their old senile dog.  All of them very very happy for me to get on with my adventure of cruising around the islands and collecting STDs, but they’re leaving for a couple of months before I take off, so won’t be able to see me leave or really do much besides hiring somebody to cut those damn trees.  I promised to take a video, gave them link to this website.
