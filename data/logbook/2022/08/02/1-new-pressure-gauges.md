# New pressure gauges

My hydraulic lines for the original propulsion system had two broken 100 psi pressure gauges right above hydraulic oil filters.  Since I haven’t installed my electric motors yet, this is what I’m gonna use for the time being.

Don’t know enough about hydraulics to say what those pressure gauges are there really for, but It’s probably to see if the filter underneath is clogged and requires change or not.

The old ones were both all rusty and very dead.  I went with [1.5" back-mounted 0–100 psi glycerin-filled stainless steel gauges with 1/8" NPT thread by Measureman](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z9RJGXS).  The original ones were 2" 0–100 psi, back-mounted as well, but didn’t look like they were liquid-filled — probably the reason why they got messed up so badly.  Sadly, 2.5" don’t even fit in there — Winters makes seemingly very good ones, but brands like WIKA or Measureman should do just as well.
