# MMSI

Finally filled out that form for getting MMSI for my AIS from FCC today.

It had to be done via FCC because my catamaran can and hopefully will go offshore and to visit other countries.  And of course there was a one-time fee of $185.  Not an arm and a leg, but just WTF, what for?

In 2–3 days I should have it in my email.  Then I’ll be able to connect my AIS and later get a modern DSC VHF radio to also use the same MMSI for my comms.  That number belongs to my vessel just like the federal registration number.

I guess the value of my boat has gone up by $185 today.  Or I’m just $185 poorer, all depends on how you look at it.

Wanted to have a cool call sign, something like **MEOW**, **KTTY**/**KITTY**, or at least **CRCT**/**CURC**/**CURCT**.  Gave them a call, a very chill and friendly dude said that it’s all random and can’t be customized like vanity plates or HAM radio call signs… it also sounded like he gets that same question all the time, he basically right away brought me the disenchanting piece of information after I mentioned I had a question regarding the call sign.

Hey, at least I tried.
