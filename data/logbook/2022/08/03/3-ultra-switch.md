# Ultra switch

Replaced broken Rule floating switch with one of solid-state Johnson Pumps’ Ultima switches that I bought months ago.  It’s currently used with a 2000 gph pump, and all the old wires seem to be oxidized and became extremely brittle after 24 years.  Their silicone jackets are still holding up great though!  I’ll have to rewire pretty much the whole boat, good thing that I can do it bit-by-bit and currently have almost everything working.

The switch isn’t mounted yet but seems to be working fine.  Found it hilarious how I see pumps and their switches mounted using screws directly to the hull of the boat below the water line, while the very first page of the manual for that switch says how a piece of marine plywood must be epoxied first, and then the pump must be mounted on it using short screws.  I swear some people just want to sink.  I will of course not use wood, I hate wood.  I'll 3D print something hollow but sturdy and epoxy that to the hull.
