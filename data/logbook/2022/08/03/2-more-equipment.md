# More equipment

My [nke](https://nke-marine-electronics.com) autopilot and electronics are finally on their way to Bob & Annie’s, and I’m also in the process of ordering [B&G](https://www.bandg.com)’s AIS, HALO20+ radar, along with their ultra-bright glass helm chart plotter.  Randy from [Charleston Yachting](https://www.charlestonyachting.com) was of great help to pick, order, and get those toys delivered, so big kudos and shout out to the guy!

AIS will help me see other ships and be seen as well, and chart plotter is just so much better than using iPhone or paper charts, not to mention the ones I have are really dated.

Can’t wait to leave, really overstayed here, plus need to make cockroaches go extinct and avoid letting new ones on board in the future.  It’s great that thanks to Bob & Annie’s I had a shipping address and dumpster to use here, will certainly miss those luxuries.  I’ll likely soon kill my Amazon Prime membership and rely mostly on what I grow, catch, or print on my 3D printer.
