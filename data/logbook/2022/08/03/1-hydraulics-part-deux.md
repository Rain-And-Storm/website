# Hydraulics! Part Deux

Ken’s help taking and diagnosing the hydraulic motor on the right side was absolutely immeasurable.  He had to use his Ryobi impact wrench to take one of the bolts off.

The good news is that the motor is okay, it was rotating just fine in both directions once detachend from the prop shaft.  Buying a new motor like that would’ve been at least 2 grand.  Anyway, the prop shaft was the problem this whole time.  After pouring some linear rail oil that I have for lubricating my 3D printer, and slowly working that shaft bit-by-bit with bare hands, I was finally able to turn it 360 degrees.  This means that my cat now officially has two working screws!

The bad news is that the stuffing box was covered in salt crystals and got glued to the stainless steel rotor, and when I set it loose, it started pouring seawater into the bilge.  It was a bit scary at first because my floting switch on that side is broken and can only be activated manually, but after a couple of seconds it became more mild and then reduced itself to just dripping.  It’s still filling the bilge slowly with saltwater, but I should be fine.
At some point I might switch to dripless stuffing box, perhaps even use that as a source of water either for my water maker or to flush toilets, getting rid of one or more through-hulls.  Might be a bad idea, dunno yet... something to think about.

Ken’s grease gun worked extremely well on bush bearings.  It sealed them well.  That grease should last for many years.  He said that grease fittings were rusty, which is a very unusual thing to happen.

Ken and Julie also said they know a captain here who operates a barge with two screws five days a week.  That could be a good idea to reduce my chance of bumping into something along the way.  They also suggested towing me and going through the canal with a range meter to find narrow spots and develop plan of action going through those.  And they’ve recommended me to watch Captain Ron.  I love Kurt Russell, surprised I haven’t seen that one.  Last but not least, Ken used to rewire diesels back in the day, I almost asked him to help me do that to mine so that I don’t have to hotwire it every time I need to get it running, but didn’t want to be one of those people whom you give an inch and they take a mile.

Folks from Bob & Annie’s congratulated me and recommended running the thing for a couple of minutes just to make sure none of the hydraulics "blow up" after being without use for so long.  Good advice.

Having good friends makes all the difference in life.
