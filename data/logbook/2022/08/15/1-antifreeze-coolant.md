# Antifreeze / coolant

My engine seems to be leaking coolant.  Putting water just makes it slowly drip and lose liquid up to a certain level.  Ken used to work a lot on diesels, suggested that the engine block may be cracked if it overheated before.  I hope not.  It won’t explode or anything like that, but my electric motors are far from being installed, so that engine and those hydraulics is all I’ve got to move around so far.

Ordered some [marine-safe antifreeze from West Marine](https://www.westmarine.com/west-marine-engine-antifreeze-coolant-gallon-337447.html), if I leak that into the water it won’t harm any fishies — I hope.
