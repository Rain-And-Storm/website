# Love letters

My name and hailing port vinyls are done and should be on their way.  I used [Lettering.com](https://lettering.com) since they seem to have their shit together.  Used Arial Rounded in Bold — curvy and serious enough to fit my cat’s appearance.

Didn’t splurge on any kind of fancy adhesives or materials, it’s all temporary anyway since I urgently need to paint the boat, in different color.
