# Glass helm

Ordered [16" Zeus³S Glass Helm chartplotter](https://www.bandg.com/bg/series/zeuss-glass-helm/integrated-display-processor/zeus3s-gh-mfd-16-display-only) from [Charleston Yachting](https://www.charlestonyachting.com).  That Zeus was the last one their supplier had, lucky me!

B&G makes those screens in 16, 19, and 24 inch sizes.  24 might be too big for my boat, she’s not a cruise ship, 19 is not that much bigger than 16, and they all have the same exact resolution – 1080p.  This tragically means that the larger the display, the worse the picture quality.  I also rather buy a couple of 16" screens and place them side-by-side, instead of cramming my chart, radar, and sonar all on the same large screen.  It’s also good for redundancy.

If 16" turns out to be not enough, I’ll sell it and get 19", or move the 16" outside next to my helm and keep the larger display inside at my nav station.
