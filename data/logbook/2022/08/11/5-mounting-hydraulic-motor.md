# Mounting hydraulic motor

Got my 9/16"-18 316 stainless steel bolts and locking nuts from [FMW Fasteners](https://www.fmwfasteners.com).

Putting the motor back on wasn't easy, had to buy some 316 stainless steel washers from nearby parts store to make the whole thing a bit more shiny and corrosion-resistant.

The disc coupling is by Frontline Industries, Inc.  It doesn’t say much besides that it’s "BIG BOY" and its HUB-SIZE is "A".  Pretty cryptic, but I love the name.  There’s another maker of flexible couplings, called [Lovejoy](https://www.lovejoy-inc.com) — great names all over!

Both motors work now.  Not a fan of hydraulics and can’t wait to replace all that desel-hydraulic mess with electric motors.  But first need to get out of here and go where I can be lifted out of the water.
