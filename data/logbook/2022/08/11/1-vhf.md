# VHF

Sorted out coaxial mess in the engine room and ran the cable from the antenna that’s on top of my mast to my old Raytheon RAY210VHF radio unit.  It’s working!  And suddenly, like magic, I feel as if I have lots of friends with boats.

If lightning strikes, there’s now a higher chance it’ll probably fry not just my radio, but the rest of the electronics with AGM batteries on top of that.  Let’s hope it doesn’t.
