# Wheel brake

Researched Edson wheel systems a bit.  I have two helms, and the most puzzling thing about them so far was holes on fiberglass pedestals to the left of the port helm and to the right of the starboard one.  Really scratched my head hard on that one, thought at first those were mounting holes for horn push buttons that were never installed, but it seems like the mystery is now finally solved.

Enter [Edson Pedestal Wheel Brake](https://edsonmarine.com/pedestal-wheel-brake-for-pre-2003-steerers/)!  Says "pre-2003", and my boat is like fiver years older than that, so that must be it.  Newer models of their helms seem to have a lever of sorts instead of a sinkable overpriced pin that's easy to lose.  Not sure if I should upgrade or buy those wheel brakes since Iâ€™m a single-handed sailor, gotta think about it before I set the sail.

The worst part is now I have to drill a new hole for my horn buttons, and I have absolutely no idea where to put them to make it comfy and intuitive.
