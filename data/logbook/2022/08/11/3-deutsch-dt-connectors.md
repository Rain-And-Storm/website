# DEUTSCH DT connectors

Purchased some IP66-ish connectors off Amazon.  The brand is JPReady, Made in China, but I just want to try them out before looking for something of higher quality.  [Würth](https://www.wurthusa.com) seems to only have ones with too many pins, and largely out of stock.  Folks at [TE Connectivity](https://te.com) have [much wider selection](https://www.te.com/usa-en/product-CAT-D487-CH8172.html?q=&d=545388%20545389&type=products&samples=N&inStoreWithoutPL=false&instock=N), plus they stock them in black.

Steve from [Salty Steve’s](https://www.saltystevesmarina.com) has told me about those connectors.  I was looking for something marine-grade, or at least water-resistant to connect my bilge pumps, switches, and other gizmos that don’t have high loads.  MasterCraft pumps come with those attached, so he’s not the only one who uses them for boats.  Steve said he puts solder into them instead of crimping to ensure proper contact.  I’ll do the same.  Don’t have a torch, and not planning on having any open flames aboard Curious Cat, but soldering iron and lots of patience should do it.  The thickest my wires for pumps get is 14 AWG, but I’ll use 12 AWG pins just to be safe, and to make them harder to bend.  10 AWG should probably be my goal, but for now these will do just to learn how to properly work with them.

The hardest part will be developing a system of wiring 2- and 3-wire connections, so that it makes sense and is consistent across all of my electric connections, e.g. to quickly swap my high bilge water alarm’s Ultima switch with my pump’s Ultima switch if it suddenly gives up the ghost.
