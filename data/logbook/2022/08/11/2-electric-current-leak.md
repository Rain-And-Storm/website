# Electric current leak

There’s apparently an electric current leak somewhere on the boat — the load current on my switch panel shows around 250–450 (whatever the units are), used to be 001–015 at most under load, and this is both when everything is on and off.

Found more stray wires that should’ve caused big fire by now but somehow haven’t, so will be removing and insulating them today, but it’s probably that Ultima switch that I installed a couple days ago, at least that’s the main suspect.  Could be my adventures with rewiring mast lights.
