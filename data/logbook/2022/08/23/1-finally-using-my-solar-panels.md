# Finally using my solar panels

Haven’t mounted Victron BlueSolar MPPT controllers yet, but couldn’t use fresh water pump anymore so had to connect things together quick and dirty just to see how well everything works.  And also really want to take a shower and have my fridge working again — drinking warm bottled water in Florida summer isn’t exactly refreshing.

The voltage level showed below 9V last night, wasn’t enough to even properly power my LED lighting, surprised they turned on at all.

4 AWG cables I bought for my PV setup turned out to be a bit too thick for those controllers’ openings, had to remove a couple of strands.  Black (negative) cables seem to have way more smaller strands than red (positive).  Only had to remove a couple from the red cable, while the black one had to lose like 15–20% of its thickness, weird.

Terminals are crimped on them.  I assumed people who made those cables knew what they were doing.  I was wrong.  It’s not too hard to remove terminals from those cables if you pull real hard, and the spot where they stripped the cable has some of the copper strands damaged, so that’s 3.9 AWG right there.  If one of those strands falls off and into my charge controller, then I’ll likely need to buy a new controller.  Will DIY cables from this point forward, can’t trust anyone.  And no crimping on my boat, only solder.

The voltage has gone up to 11 volts within about thirty minutes, that’s a good sign.  I have half of my 0.68KW photovoltaic system hooked up right now, only one out of two MPPT controllers used.  My multimeter shows something like 63V from those two panels, pretty good.  I’m also only hooked up right now to one battery, and I really should charge across the battery bank.  Lyall from Sun Powered Yacht said that, "You are better to charge across the battery bank like you say so eg pos bat 1 and neg bat 3.  It’s no way near as efficient to put them both on battery 1 and it ’waterfalls’ down through the bank".  I’ll get there, just first need to properly mount these babies and craft cables of correct gauge and with nice soldered terminals.
