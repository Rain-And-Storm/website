# Diesel

Bob, the owner of a lot next to the one where I rent the dock, came back to do some work on his land and giant RV that’s parked there.  Turns out he’s married to a very cool lady, Sue.  Sue said "we have to help him" when I said I don’t own a car and need to get some canisters and buy diesel for my boat.  He drove me to Tractor Supply and gas station to get it.  I think it was the first time I pumped diesel, definitely my first time putting fuel in a jerry can.  Not something I expected to be doing for my electric-solar catamaran, but I have to get her moving before the conversion happens, it is what it is.

Bob has told a very interesting thing to me, said 9/10 of a gallon is what you get when you pump, it’s this way all around the country.  He used to pump gas as a teen in the 70s.  Supposedly it’s true and not many know it.  So, when you buy 10 gallons of any fuel at a pump, you only get 9.

I should make a video about it at some point and hope it goes viral.
