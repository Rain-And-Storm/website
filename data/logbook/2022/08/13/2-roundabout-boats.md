# Roundabout

Saw [this beautiful round fishing boat](https://roundaboutwatercrafts.com) floating past me in the canal the other day.  At first I thought that the guy made it himself, but then saw the brand's name on it.

The site doesn't say if it's unsinkable.  It better be.  Asked them via their contact form, will post answer here if I get it.

They replied quickly, "They have actually been shot multiple times and have not sank.".  I guess that makes them unsinkable.
