# Wheel brakes

Found two shafts with thread on them that seem to be the wheel brakes for my helms that I’ve learned about only a week ago.  Nice surprise.  They’re dirty though.

Not even gonna try to use them right now, and probably won’t need at all.  The hole in the helm station is really great for insects to get into the boat, and I don’t want that, rather keep the tape on it.  I’ll try to see if it’s reasonable to upgrade that Edson wheel to a post-2003 version where the wheel break is integrated into the station and doesn’t leave a hole in it, can’t just roll away and get lost, sink.  Maybe my autopilot will have a button on it to hold the helm in place, not sure yet how versatile it is.
