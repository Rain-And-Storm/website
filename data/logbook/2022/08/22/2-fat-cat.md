Inspired by shallow areas that I witnessed yesterday, I’ll try my best to make the boat lighter.  This means no extra fresh water outside of my main tank, no solar showers.

Will try to fix and sell the 60 lbs gasoline outboard that I have sitting in my cockpit before I depart, and then things like old microwave, gas oven and stovetop — also need to go, either CraigsList or trash.

Every inch of draft counts, it can make a difference between getting stuck somewhere and not.  I can always get more fresh water when I dock somewhere in Charleston or Tampa.

And those extra 20 gallons of diesel aren’t helping either.  But have to have it, my fuel tank is only 30 gallons.
