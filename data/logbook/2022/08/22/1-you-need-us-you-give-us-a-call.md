# You need us, you give us a call!

A TowBoatUS RIB came by my boat today.  I was hoping it was that captain Ryan who refused to tow me with trees and boats in the way when I needed their help, so now I really wanted to see the look on his face and hear what he has to say about me being neatly docked past that point.

It was some other guy.  He waved.  Here’s our conversation:

- Him: That’s a badass boat!
- Me: Thanks!
- Him: Yours?
- Me: Yep.
- Him: That’s awesome.
- Him: You need us, you give us a call!

I nodded and chuckled a little when he said that, but wasn’t laughing at him, and he’s got no idea what the other captain told me and how useless TowBoatUS has been for me overall.

And, yes, it is a badass boat.
