# WINCHES

- Cockpit winches: 3 x 44 & 2 x 50
- Fasteners needed: 5 for 44 & 6 for 50
- 5x3 + 6x2 = 15 + 12 = 27

For now, let's do 1 x 44 & 2 x 50

5 + 6x2 = 17


Curious Cat will get M8 countersunk screws instead of 5/16"-18, just because they're more common, a bit thicker, and winches don't get pulled "out", rather to the side... smaller thread of M8 (1.25mm pitch distance instead of 1.412mm) also means more shallow thread, equals thicker base of the screw (good, stronger) â€” the minor diameter of 5/16"-18 is 6.243mm, while M8 has it at 6.647mm.

Platforms vary in size and angle, and the newly installed mending plates will do so, too.  Due to the angle, those will be some very thick mending plates underneath the winches, but why not?  This way I could use screws of the same length.

Winch base thickness:
- 7.41mm for 50
- 6.58mm for 44

The mending plates should be at least 6mm thick.  So, what we need from each fastener's length is:
winch base thickness + longest tunnel (screw hole) length + 6mm + 4mm for nut cap = [the thread should start no later than that]

Each winch is a special case here, due to the fact that we want the screw to be smooth for as long as possible, and depending on the angle, each mending plate will have its own unique max thickness.  I could calculate the length more precisely on paper, but won't do that right now, since it can be done manually by just measuring the physical thing I have in front of me.

Last but not least, the "length" of every countersunk screw includes the cap.  It's a very important thing to keep in mind and account for.

Each mending plate will have a 2mm hexagonal indent in it, that's why.
