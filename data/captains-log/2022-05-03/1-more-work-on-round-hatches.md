# More work on round hatches

Turns out the round hatches are all glued shut, not just stuck.  It's a security feature, not a bug.
They're all old and most of the plastic outside was eaten by the sun long ago, currently cracked and glued multiple times.  They all need to be replaced.

Since they won't open, some nuts just can't be easily detached from the thread â€” the screw they're on rotates along with the nut when I try to unscrew it.  Oscillating tool will help with that, but plastic dust is not fun.  Good thing I have a respirator.

Most likely the hatches were installed and not glued right away, then somebody later decided to glue them shut to prevent any break-ins, since those hatches lack proper locking mechanism.  Too bad they didn't think about how to detach them from the hull once it's all glued together and can't reveal the screws, but that's okay, just another fun little adventure.
I'm probably going to cut around them anyway, if I go with six bigger (22") round hatches on the sides, and four 700mm square hatches in front, all by Lewmar.
