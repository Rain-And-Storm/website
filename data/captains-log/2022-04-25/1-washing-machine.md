# Washing machine

My Daewoo DWD-35MCRCR is here.  Folks at [Bob & Annie's Boatyard](https://bobandannies.com) had to write a $40+ check to UPS for delivery.
Some 1970s' shit, no idea why UPS only accepts checks in this day and age.

It's a washer+dryer combo.  220V, but that's what I plan for my boat to have when I finally get her rewired.
In my mind, low voltage should stay as low as possible (12V and not 24V) — to save copper and just keep it less sparky,
and high voltage should stay as high as possible (240V and not 120V) — so that when you need it to be high, you really have it as high as it comes.  I'll only need it for my computers, induction stovetop, and this washer/dryer.
I've never liked these flimsy tiny 110V plugs that end up getting their terminals bent all the time.

Bumped into Randy, the guy who owns the yard.
He used to be a firefighter, told me that it's important to use marine electric wires because they're designed to flex and move.
Household ones eventually break and that's how shorts happen.
He briefly mentioned a 80' boat that ended up burning down because the owner decided to hire a household electrician to do all the wiring.  Cheap becomes expensive.

The box was big but huggable.  30Kg.  As I was carrying it out of the store, one of the customers held the door for me.  An older gentleman.
He then offered to help me get it to my boat by putting it in his truck.  When I asked for his name, he answered, "Wolf", and then paused for a second.
I legit thought his name was Wolf.  But then he added, "Gary, Gary Wolf".  That was a relief, his first name wasn't really Wolf.
I introduced myself by my first name, and immidiately felt regret, I should've given him my last name as well, out of respect for sharing his last name with me.
Or I should've pulled the same trick on him, say my last name, take a pause, and then give the full name.
Maybe he heard my accent and wanted to know where I'm from, so gave his name for me to give mine, so he could then ask where that's from.
He had a tiny super-friendly dog that turned out to be named Sam.  No last name, just Sam.

I love Florida, everybody drives a truck here, genuinely friendly, laid-back, and very kind.  Pine Island is a great place to be stuck in, I almost don't want to leave.
