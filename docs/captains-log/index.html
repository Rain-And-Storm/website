<p>Ken and Julie stopped by their resort today, Ken had a bit of time to help me sort out wiring for my diesel engine, really cool guy who loves machines.  Using the panel at the helm to start the boat’s engine instead of reaching into the engine compartment is much more preferable.  Safer, faster, less embarrassing.</p>
<p>The wiring is a mess, all covered in oil and whatever else.  The most interesting part was a Volvo 841177 relay that has “W-Germany” written on it.  That means it’s more than 32 years old, older than me.  Tektron/TEK-composites likely bought a box of them in the 80s or the early 90s and ended up sticking them into their boats and planes that they produced in the late 90s and the early 00s.  It obviously refuses to work today, produced no clicking sound when we wanted it to.
When I tried wipind its contacts, the transparent rubbery insulation on the bottom just started crumbling like a freshly baked cookie.</p>
<p>Ordered a replacement from Bob &amp; Annie’s boatyard, it should be here Monday.</p>
<p>The relay socket might need to get replaced as well, but first I need to get the relay to work, I rather not have to solder four old copper wires.</p></a></div></div><div><div class="content"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 26.08.2022</h1><a id="fiber-optic-lights"></a><h1>Fiber optic lights</h1>
<p>Reached out to <a href="https://www.lopolight.com">Lopolight</a> regarding possibility of using fiber optics instead of copper.  The main advantages should be weight reduction as well as ease of maintenance, especially of the masthead light.  Less copper to carry lightning strikes down to my sailboat’s electronics, too.</p>
<p>They said they can’t help me with that project, that’s just not something they do.  But was happy to learn that they’re all sailors and the name "Lo po" comes from “low power” — they specialize in lightweight and low-power lights for vessels.  They did refer me to <a href="http://rslfibersystems.com">RSL Fiber Systems</a> though, which seem to be specializing in proividing fiber optics-based lights for marine vessels, specifically US NAVY’s Zumwalt ships.  Hooyah!</p>
<p>RSL have informed me that their illuminator (light source) costs $50K and weighs whopping 75 lbs — a bit of an overkill for any sailboat.  But they’re working on a sub-$1000 model that’s about 6–9 months away, and if it’s small and light enough and doesn’t consume a whole lot of energy, could be what I’m looking for.  Using the same light source for my spreader lights and underwater lights could make a significant difference in the amount of copper my boat will carry, as well as make thru-hulls for underwater lights much smaller.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiberplusinc.com/services-offered/benefits-fiber-optic-cables/">This article</a> states that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fiber cables are much thinner and lighter than copper wires. A fiber cable can weigh about four pounds per 1000 feet, compared to copper wires, which can weigh 39 pounds per 1000 ft. The lightweight fiber optics then require less space for functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No idea if it’s accounting for two wires or just one, but pretty neat either way, 10 or 20 times lighter.  I think it’s for two copper wires vs. one fiber cable, since it mentions “fiber cable” and “copper wires”.  But ten times lighter, wow.</p><a id="fenders-with-titanium-rings"></a><h1>Fenders with titanium rings</h1>
<p>I’m trying to have as little stainless steel on my boat as possible.  Cleaning it is little to no fun, and even 316 tends to be generally weaker than grade 5 or even grade 2 titanium.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://aeredockingsolutions.com">AERE Docking Solutions</a> yesterday, they got back to me today confirming that rings on their fenders are stainless steel.  It might be possible to either do a custom order for fenders with titanium rings, or buy the usual ones they sell, cut those rings off, and then replace with carabines of sorts from <a href="https://www.alliedtitanium.com">Allied Titanium</a>.  Getting something custom signed with "Curious Cat" might be better though, no way to steal those rings if they’re not detachable, and if the fenders are personalized, nobody will try to steal those as well (I think).</p></div></div><div><div></div></div></div>
