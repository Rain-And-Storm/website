<p>Sorted out coaxial mess in the engine room and ran the cable from the antenna that’s on top of my mast to my old Raytheon RAY210VHF radio unit.  It’s working!  And suddenly, like magic, I feel as if I have lots of friends with boats.</p>
<p>If lightning strikes, there’s now a higher chance it’ll probably fry not just my radio, but the rest of the electronics with AGM batteries on top of that.  Let’s hope it doesn’t.</p><h1>Electric current leak</h1>
<p>There’s apparently an electric current leak somewhere on the boat — the load current on my switch panel shows around 250–450 (whatever the units are), used to be 001–015 at most under load, and this is both when everything is on and off.</p>
<p>Found more stray wires that should’ve caused big fire by now but somehow haven’t, so will be removing and insulating them today, but it’s probably that Ultima switch that I installed a couple days ago, at least that’s the main suspect.  Could be my adventures with rewiring mast lights.</p><h1>DEUTSCH DT connectors</h1>
<p>Purchased some IP66-ish connectors off Amazon.  The brand is JPReady, Made in China, but I just want to try them out before looking for something of higher quality.  Würth seems to only have ones with too many pins, and largely out of stock.  Folks at TE Connectivity have much wider selection, plus they stock them in black.</p>
<p>Steve from Salty Steve’s has told me about those connectors.  I was looking for something marine-grade, or at least water-resistant to connect my bilge pumps, switches, and other gizmos that don’t have high loads.  MasterCraft pumps come with those attached, so he’s not the only one who uses them for boats.  Steve said he puts solder into them instead of crimping to ensure proper contact.  I’ll do the same.  Don’t have a torch, and not planning on having any open flames aboard Curious Cat, but soldering iron and lots of patience should do it.  The thickest my wires for pumps get is 14 AWG, but I’ll use 12 AWG pins just to be safe, and to make them harder to bend.  10 AWG should probably be my goal, but for now these will do just to learn how to properly work with them.</p>
<p>The hardest part will be developing a system of wiring 2- and 3-wire connections, so that it makes sense and is consistent across all of my electric connections, e.g. to quickly swap my high bilge water alarm’s Ultima switch with my pump’s Ultima switch if it suddenly gives up the ghost.</p><h1>Wheel brake</h1>
<p>Researched Edson wheel systems a bit.  I have two helms, and the most puzzling thing about them so far was holes on fiberglass pedestals to the left of the port helm and to the right of the starboard one.  Really scratched my head hard on that one, thought at first those were mounting holes for horn push buttons that were never installed, but it seems like the mystery is now finally solved.</p>
<p>Enter Edson Pedestal Wheel Brake!  Says "pre-2003", and my boat is like fiver years older than that, so that must be it.  Newer models of their helms seem to have a lever of sorts instead of a sinkable overpriced pin that's easy to lose.  Not sure if I should upgrade or buy those wheel brakes since I’m a single-handed sailor, gotta think about it before I set the sail.</p>
<p>The worst part is now I have to drill a new hole for my horn buttons, and I have absolutely no idea where to put them to make it comfy and intuitive.</p><h1>Mounting hydraulic motor</h1>
<p>Got my 9/16"-18 316 stainless steel bolts and locking nuts from FMW Fasteners.</p>
<p>Putting the motor back on wasn't easy, had to buy some 316 stainless steel washers from nearby parts store to make the whole thing a bit more shiny and corrosion-resistant.</p>
<p>The disc coupling is by Frontline Industries, Inc.  It doesn’t say much besides that it’s "BIG BOY" and its HUB-SIZE is "A".  Pretty cryptic, but I love the name.  There’s another maker of flexible couplings, called Lovejoy — great names all over!</p>
<p>Both motors work now.  Not a fan of hydraulics and can’t wait to replace all that desel-hydraulic mess with electric motors.  But first need to get out of here and go where I can be lifted out of the water.</p></a></div></div><div><div><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 13.08.2022</h1><a id="diesel"></a><h1>Diesel</h1>
<p>Bob, the owner of a lot next to the one where I rent the dock, came back to do some work on his land and giant RV that’s parked there.  Turns out he’s married to a very cool lady, Sue.  Sue said "we have to help him" when I said I don’t own a car and need to get some canisters and buy diesel for my boat.  He drove me to Tractor Supply and gas station to get it.  I think it was the first time I pumped diesel, definitely my first time putting fuel in a jerry can.  Not something I expected to be doing for my electric-solar catamaran, but I have to get her moving before the conversion happens, it is what it is.</p>
<p>Bob has told a very interesting thing to me, said 9/10 of a gallon is what you get when you pump, it’s this way all around the country.  He used to pump gas as a teen in the 70s.  Supposedly it’s true and not many know it.  So, when you buy 10 gallons of any fuel at a pump, you only get 9.</p>
<p>I should make a video about it at some point and hope it goes viral.</p><a id="roundabout-boats"></a><h1>Roundabout</h1>
<p>Saw <a href="https://roundaboutwatercrafts.com">this beautiful round fishing boat</a> floating past me in the canal the other day.  At first I thought that the guy made it himself, but then saw the brand's name on it.</p>
<p>The site doesn't say if it's unsinkable.  It better be.  Asked them via their contact form, will post answer here if I get it.</p>
<p>They replied quickly, "They have actually been shot multiple times and have not sank.".  I guess that makes them unsinkable.</p></div></div><div><div><a href="../../../2022/08/14/"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 14.08.2022</h1><h1>Adventure</h1>
<p>Departed around 1500, Ken and Julie joined me aboard, and without them I’d not be writing this right now.</p>
<p>The task seemed easy at first, I planned to go through the canal on my own, since the boat now has both props working.  Or so I thought.  The props were turning, but the wind kept pushing us back.  Thanks to Ken my boat didn’t hit a seawall across from the dock where I stayed for 5 months — we both had to push the boat away with our feet as we tried to gain momentum.</p>
<p>They brought two hooks with them just in case we needed to push away from boat lifts and other boats.  Spoiler alert: both of those hooks are now dead, I will buy them new ones tomorrow, the least I could do.</p>
<p>After moving at around 2 knots, at some point we hit a wind tunnel of sorts, and the boat just refused to move, we were giving it full throttle but were stuck in one spot, it felt quite embarrassing.  At that point a lady in pink waived from the shore, and it turned out it was Becky, the owner of the land where I rented the dock from.  Small island.  She’s renting a house there.  Becky and her husband have lots of money.  She helped us get tied to cleats and hold the catamaran in place.  Ken got off, went to his truck, and drove back to get his 27’ Worldcat with two 250 hp outboards.</p>
<p>Towing didn’t go smooth at all,  My boat hit somebody’s lift and I’ll likely have to go back there tomorrow and asses the damage, compensate them if needed.  One guy got out of his house to help me out, took his hook and really helped us getting away from his dock.  That turn wasn’t fun at all, and Ken barely had any room to turn his boat, communicating was real hard too, since I was near the bow on port side, Julie was at the helm steering the boat (starboard), and Ken was all the way up, with two running gasoline outboards between us.  Both of the hooks died during that maneuver, it was me who killed them, but truth being told they weren’t too strong for that task, I tried using my feet and those hooks, but there was just too much power coming from Ken’s boat, I couldn’t fight that.  At some point towing line got into Ken’s starboard prop, that needed to be untied.</p>
<p>We finally got out of that choke, headed straight for the spot where trees were cut for me to pass few days ago by kind owners of that lot.  Of course the company they hired didn’t touch mangroves, and some of the trees that they’ve cut ended up in the canal.  But still an improvement, now the tip of my mast wasn’t going to hit any trees.  Two boats that I communicated with and spoke about this whole thing for like two weeks decided not to move out of my way for some reason.  No idea why and how, I texted both of them, they were both aboard and aware of me going through.  Thanks to that, my boat basically dug through mangroves and trees with her port side, I had lots and lots of branches hitting my face and body.  I’ve done my best to make them not bend my stanchions and not damage my standing rigging.  At one point I asked Ken to stop the boat and give me two minutes.  I rushed to grab my Ryobi oscillating tool and cut two branches right there, one of them ended up sitting on my foredeck.  Had those boats moved, we would not have had that problem with branches.</p>
<p>Bob and Sue who own the lot next to the dock I stayed at saw me moving, came closer to the water to see and help with the lines, and while the boat was entangled in tree branches, Sue asked me if I like where I am now more than where I was... funny.</p>
<p>Lots more scratches on the boat now, but she needes new topcoat anyway, so it’s all good.</p>
<p>Further ahead there was a trimaran with two lines stretching from his starboard side across the canal to trees on the other side.  Luckily, they were underwater.  He uses those to secure himself in the middle of the canal 
in case of a storm.  I’m pretty sure if the tide wasn’t at its highest, we would’ve grabbed those lines at least with one of Curious Cat’s rudders.</p>
<p>Boats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Honc Marine barge with a tractor on it that I called and asked to be removed last week — thankfully gone</li>
<li>50-something foot monohull powerboat — Rick, moved out of the way shortly while I was stuck in the canal fighting wind</li>
<li>36’ catamaran — Al, never moved, I had to cut trees and almost lost an eye or two fighting branches</li>
<li>Small power monohull — no idea who the owner is, never was a problem</li>
<li>Large 50-something foot power boat that cooks meth — no comment</li>
<li>30-something foot trimaran — owned by Dave, non-funcitonal engine, had two lines tied to its starboard and laying on the bottom of the canal</li>
</ol>
<p>After that the path to Golden Palms was clear, we tied the boat to the dock, and now I was welcomed back to the resort I stayed at when I just got to this island.  I even have WiFi here.</p>
<p>The problem is, I’m taking more than 50% of the canal’s width here, and the legal limit is 25%.  I have to clean the bottom, rewire the engine, fix my props, find out what else could be wrong, and then leave St James City and go up up up.</p>
<p>Things learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you can actually move the boat before leaving the dock</li>
<li>Spend money on a diver next time or get own scuba gear and clean the boat yourself</li>
<li>Even small wind can really throw a catamaran around</li>
<li>Helms must to have a center indicator that never gets moved</li>
<li>Mount GoPro on your head next time</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s dumb to waste time or rely on people who don't have jobs and live on old boats</li>
<li>The island is very small</li>
<li>Fuck TowBoatUS</li>
