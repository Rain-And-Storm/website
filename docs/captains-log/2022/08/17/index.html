<p>My engine seems to be leaking coolant.  Putting water just makes it slowly drip and lose liquid up to a certain level.  Ken used to work a lot on diesels, suggested that the engine block may be cracked if it overheated before.  I hope not.  It won’t explode or anything like that, but my electric motors are far from being installed, so that engine and those hydraulics is all I’ve got to move around so far.</p>
<p>Ordered some marine-safe antifreeze from West Marine, if I leak that into the water it won’t harm any fishies — I hope.</p></a></div></div><div><div class="content"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 17.08.2022</h1><a id="wheel-brakes"></a><h1>Wheel brakes</h1>
<p>Found two shafts with thread on them that seem to be the wheel brakes for my helms that I’ve learned about only a week ago.  Nice surprise.  They’re dirty though.</p>
<p>Not even gonna try to use them right now, and probably won’t need at all.  The hole in the helm station is really great for insects to get into the boat, and I don’t want that, rather keep the tape on it.  I’ll try to see if it’s reasonable to upgrade that Edson wheel to a post-2003 version where the wheel break is integrated into the station and doesn’t leave a hole in it, can’t just roll away and get lost, sink.  Maybe my autopilot will have a button on it to hold the helm in place, not sure yet how versatile it is.</p></div></div><div><div><a href="../../../2022/08/19/" class="content"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 19.08.2022</h1><h1>Diver</h1>
<p>Found a local diver to clean the bottom and check my props.  Name's Weston.  Chill guy, looks like a fireman — tall, porn stache, red hair.  Local to Pine Island, originally from Hawaii.  Gave me Kamaʻāina, so thanks for that.  But no matter what, it's not cheap — not an easy job to do, she's not been cleaned for at least 6 months.</p>
<p>Said my starboard prop seems to have way more growth on it than the other one... which makes sense, I could barely see any effect from running power to that side five days ago.  Hope we won't have to take them off, that'd be a real nightmare.</p>
<p>Took some videos from the dock, asked him to film if he finds anything interesting.  Maybe will make a video later for my channel.</p><h1>Lewmar Ocean track car upstands</h1>
<p>Installed three shiny white cubes for my mainsheet traveler car.  No idea what they’re for, but those were missing, so felt like I had to put the thing back together.  I think they’re supposed to hold sheets attached to the boom or something like that...  will figure out later.</p><h1>Zeus</h1>
<p>My 16" Zeus Glass Helm is here.  Will probably install inside at first, use Bluetooth and my tablet to access charts from outside.  It’s $7000, I’m not too comfortable putting that thing outside yet, maybe will do later.  Cutting a giant hole for it is also not something I’m dying to do.</p><h1>It’s alive!</h1>
<p>After the diver was done, I fired up the engine and was able to move the boat forward and back, it finally managed to stir some mud in the water behind.  Might still have some problems with hydraulics and coolant, but this should be enough for me to get out of Saint James City and head to where I could paint and hopefully haul her out.  There’s a ton of electronics that I need to install on this baby.</p>
<p>Bumped into Jim not far from here, he was cheerful today, recommended me to be wary of other people’s lifts and power cables that run under water in the canal.  Said that in salt water you can feel the electric current a little bit before it hits you, but in fresh water you don’t feel it at all until the very last moment, pun intended.  He said it might be a good idea to buy an electric snorkel mask with like 30' hose, to be able to clean the boat myself when I’m back in Hawaii.  That guy is a like a walking encyclopedia, I always learn something new whenever I bump into him.</p><h1>MMSI</h1>
<p>In order to get my AIS working in international waters, I’ll need to obtain MMSI through FCC.  One YouTube video outlined this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain restricted radiotelephone operator’s permit — $0, never expires</li>
<li>Go to apps.fcc.gov/...</li>
<li>Register to get FCC account, you’ll get an FCC registration number (FRN)</li>
<li>Click on wireless.fcc.gov/..., enter your FRN number and password</li>
<li>"Apply for new license", select "SA or SB - ship"</li>
<li>File the application</li>
<li>Sign the application (first + last name), click submit</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds easy enough, hope to be done with it shortly.</p></a></div></div></div>
