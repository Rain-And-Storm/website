<p>Met a guy named Jim today.</p>
<p>He was passing my boat in his small motorized fiberglass kanoe on his way to a local bar.  He asked if this is the boat that used to be at Bob &amp; Annie’s, I said yes,
he then told me that he used to skipper my boat years ago.  I let him aboard.</p>
<p>Turned out Jim used to work at Bob &amp; Annie’s boatyard back when this boat still had big windows and only one prior owner.
He knows the vessel well, told me that the bottom part of the hull is made out of waffle veawe Kevlar.
Confirmed that the resin is epoxy, but I still need to get that gas spectrometry done just to be sure it’s not vinyl ester.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to buy this boat for 15 years, but never got the money to do so.  Jim lives on a trimaran anchored not far from here.</p>
<h2>Things learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>And The Sea Will Tell is worth reading or watching</li>
<li>Northern Bounty was originally used for Canadian Wilderness program, angry German teenagers used to learn how to sail on it (which still appears to be the case to this day)</li>
<li>Capsized is a good book to read</li>
<li>Cayo Costa State Park is a good place to visit</li>
<li>Fast 5200 to repair holes left from screws, then use scotch pad to hold it there while it cures</li>
<li>Use Liquid Weld to mount screws into the hull</li>
</ul>

<p>My Daewoo DWD-35MCRCR is here.  Folks at <a href="https://bobandannies.com">Bob &amp; Annie’s Boatyard</a> had to write a $40+ check to UPS for delivery.
Some 1970s’ shit, no idea why UPS only accepts checks in this day and age.</p>
<p>It’s a washer+dryer combo.  220V, but that’s what I plan for my boat to have when I finally get her rewired.
In my mind, low voltage should stay as low as possible (12V and not 24V) — to save copper and just keep it less sparky,
and high voltage should stay as high as possible (240V and not 120V) — so that when you need it to be high, you really have it as high as it comes.  I’ll only need it for my computers, induction stovetop, and this washer/dryer.
I’ve never liked these flimsy tiny 110V plugs that end up getting their terminals bent all the time.</p>
<p>Bumped into Randy, the guy who owns the yard.
He used to be a firefighter, told me that it’s important to use marine electric wires because they’re designed to flex and move.
Household ones eventually break and that’s how shorts happen.
He briefly mentioned a 80’ boat that ended up burning down because the owner decided to hire a household electrician to do all the wiring.  Cheap becomes expensive.</p>
<p>The box was big but huggable.  30Kg.  As I was carrying it out of the store, one of the customers held the door for me.  An older gentleman.
He then offered to help me get it to my boat by putting it in his truck.  When I asked for his name, he answered, "Wolf", and then paused for a second.
I legit thought his name was Wolf.  But then he added, "Gary, Gary Wolf".  That was a relief, his first name wasn’t really Wolf.
I introduced myself by my first name, and immidiately felt regret, I should’ve given him my last name as well, out of respect for sharing his last name with me.
Or I should’ve pulled the same trick on him, say my last name, take a pause, and then give the full name.
Maybe he heard my accent and wanted to know where I’m from, so gave his name for me to give mine, so he could then ask where that’s from.
He had a tiny super-friendly dog that turned out to be named Sam.  No last name, just Sam.</p>
<p>I love Florida, everybody drives a truck here, genuinely friendly, laid-back, and very kind.  Pine Island is a great place to be stuck in, I almost don’t want to leave.</p><a id="laptop-returned"></a><h1>Laptop returned</h1>
<p>Quit my job, the last day was Friday, had to send my laptop back.
Accidentally forgot half-finished bottle of water inside the box.
I think I’m getting old, but that’s alright.
Will be funny how they’re gonna open the package and find not just MacBook Pro in there, but also a small half-empty bottle of Aquafina.  I hope it doesn’t leak.</p><a id="finders-keepers"></a><h1>Finders keepers</h1>
<p>Saw a rectangular plastic bag floating by at around 1800.
At first thought it was a newspaper, but then realized it’s 2022, people get their brains washed online.
Turned out to be a sealed package with three Orion distress smoke signals.
Took two sticks and pulled the bag up from the bow, it’s currently resting on my trampoline, drying.
Seems like a bit of salt water got inside the bag, but they could still be good.</p></div></div><div><div><a href="../../../2022/04/27/" class="content"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 27.04.2022</h1><h1>Dead Fish</h1>
<p>Found a dead fish laying on the dock this morning.
At first thought it jumped out of the water and was still alive, not having any idea which way to go.
But then its motionless body made it obvious the fish was completely dead.
I poured a couple of buckets of fresh water on it to push it back into the ocean without having to making any contact.
Maybe some hungry dolphin will eat it.</p>
<p>These fishes jump out of the water all the time here, even small ones do that.  No idea why though.  Not that it matters.</p>
<p>I’m no CSI, but my conclusion is that the fish jumped out and landed on the dock, then had a heart attack after seeing how big and beautiful my boat is.</p></a></div></div></div>
