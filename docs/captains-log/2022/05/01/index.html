<p>Found a dead fish laying on the dock this morning.
At first thought it jumped out of the water and was still alive, not having any idea which way to go.
But then its motionless body made it obvious the fish was completely dead.
I poured a couple of buckets of fresh water on it to push it back into the ocean without having to making any contact.
Maybe some hungry dolphin will eat it.</p>
<p>These fishes jump out of the water all the time here, even small ones do that.  No idea why though.  Not that it matters.</p>
<p>I’m no CSI, but my conclusion is that the fish jumped out and landed on the dock, then had a heart attack after seeing how big and beautiful my boat is.</p></a></div></div><div><div class="content"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 01.05.2022</h1><a id="jim-2"></a><h1>Jim again</h1>
<p>Saw Jim again today, the old captain that used to skipper my boat when she was young.
He said he had some photos to show from those days, so I went to the bar where he likes to hang out, and he’s shown me three pictures
where you could see how the sail was set on her.  That should help me at least a little bit when I’m ready to depart for my next destination.</p>
<p>He’s also shown me pictures of the trimaran that he built that he currently lives on, told some stories about his past adventures.  Then we talked about trimarans for a bit, apparently he sailed on a 1984 Shuttleworth 42’ trimaran called Damiana.  She’s right now for sale for $230K in Mexico.</p><a id="secret-treasure"></a><h1>Secret Treasure</h1>
<p>While moving stuff around and cleaning up the boat, found another storage compartment.
It’s full of all things kitchen: pans, pots, plates... was rather a nice surprise, considering the fact that I’ve been refitting and living on this
boat for about a month now.
Not sure I’ll need any of that, since I have fancy Japanese and Italian cookware tucked away on Maui.
Can’t wait to ditch it all at some thrift store and bring my stuff aboard.</p></div></div><div><div><a href="../../../2022/05/02/" class="content"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 02.05.2022</h1><h1>Searchlight</h1>
<p>Traced two wires from the middle of the bow to my electrical panel.  I’m putting marked zip ties on wires to make better sense of what goes where, and eventually make everything nice and tidy.
The object of my interest today is Golight Radioray searchlight.</p>
<p>Used multimeter to find out if the voltage is there.  It is.
At first it seemed like the problem was in the lamp, but then I realized that the thing only has two wires, ergo needs to be controlled from somewhere else, remotely.  Found the remote inside the charting table.  Had to buy two A23 batteries to make it work.  Haven’t seen those in forever, forgot they’re 12V.  So small yet so powerful.  Reminded me of those tiny female anime characters that kick ass non-stop yet refuse to die.</p>
<p>I was able to turn the searchlight on, but the light from the halogen lamp was extremely dim, the thing was emitting constant clicking noise, and there was no way to turn it off or change its angle via the remote once it was on.  I believe it’s been there since day one — means over 20 years.  Maybe over 10 years, but still, it’s a long time for something that’s claiming to be "weatherproof"... it’s not even IP65.</p>
<p>Dismounted, disassembled.  Inside it had one and a half PCBs, two DC motors, lots of dead spiders, and some dirt.  I don’t expect those motors to work, most likely they’re dead, and I want them to be.</p>
<p>If I decide that I do need to have a searchlight for some reason, I’m probably going to buy a cheap waterproof LED spotlight that can recharge from the sun, and then add a couple of servos and a remote to it, potentially slap a camera on top.  This way it won’t require any wires and be as waterproof as I’ll be able to make it with my 3D printer.  New LED Golight products cost close to $700, and I don’t expect them to last — having seen what’s on the inside and how many gaps it has for dirt and salt water to enter.  Their products likely work better for cabins and offroad vehicles.</p><h1>Round hatches</h1>
<p>Those ten round hatches that were installed instead of leaky cabin windows about a decade ago, they turned out to be Jim Black,  More specifically, they are <strong>592-20RND-05-02-05</strong>.  20", but almost all stuck and leaking at this point.  The only good thing about them is that they’re tempered glass and not acrylic.  That can become a bad thing if I cut myself while removing them.</p>
<p>Trying to figure out what to replace them with.  Lewmar only makes acrylic round hatches, but if I put four square 70cm hatches
in the front to have a better view, then those will be definitely acrylic, and hence I could keep them all Lewmar without resorting to sketchy brands.  And I absolutely love how the boat looks from a side with those three round circles, I think there’s only one cat in the world that has that.  The front appearance I really hate, it looks like a retarded spider with those four round "eyes", not to mention you can barely see anything through them due to the angle.</p>
<p>Considering installing different sizes for the round ones.  It’s three on each side, that means I could make two of them 18", two 20", and two 22".  Need to do some drawing in GIMP to know if it’s a bad idea or not.  Whatever I get, I hope to be able to open them up more than 90 degrees — the current hatches say on them they can’t be opened more than 90 degrees, and that stinks.  Not that it matters, since they’re all stuck for good.</p>
<p>My other ideas include:
 - self-tinting layer or electric window tint
 - remote opening mechanism
 - mechanical shutter for round hatches (something like what analog cameras used to have)
 - OLED stickers that are see-through but emit light and hence light up the cabin when needed
 - organic solar cells to make everything above require no wires</p>
<p>It’ll be nice to open all of them when I’m finally anchored in Hawaii, the airflow in the cabin is going to be absolutely sick!</p></a></div></div></div>
