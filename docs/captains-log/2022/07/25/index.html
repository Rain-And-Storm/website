<p>I urgenty need a dinghy for my cat.  There are many options for RIBs: Zodiac, West Marine, Mercury, Inmar, Neport Vessels, and many-many more.  Truth being told, it’s going to be a temporary tender until I get unsinkable carbon ZeroJet OC300, OCTenders OC300, or Aeolos AP10.  Those are all custom made to order and take forever to arrive.  Ergo have to buy something I don’t really want to have, but rather have to have.  Going to go with Zodiac just because I want to have a known brand in order to sell her faster later this year.</p>
<p>$1300 is the rough price for the smallest aluminum bottom zody.  I hate soft bottoms.  A bit later I’ll get a tiny electric outboard, but for now oars should do just fine — good workout!</p><h1>Mast bees</h1>
<p>It appears I have a bunch of wasp hives at the top of my mast.  Sometimes wasps wander into my boat.  The smart ones realize their mistake and promptly find their way out, the not so smart end up getting zapped and then go feed the fishes.  Would explain the enthusiasm local woodpeckers have for pecking my mast.</p>
<p>I’m glad the wasps are living in there, I want them to have fun flying out to check the breeze and not being able to find their favorite tree when I sail to Tampa.  Imagine the surprise when your favorite tree ends up sailing away from you.  Hope that never happens to me — I don’t know how to fly.  But that’s what harnesses are for.</p><h1>More bees</h1>
<p>Found a little hive underneath one of storage hatches in the bow area.  At least they didn’t get inside the compartment itself — those hatch seals seem to be doing their job!  One guy escaped right away while mom and dad stuck around to raise next generation of brats.  Zapper, Dyson cordless vac — poof, whole family’s gone!  Lone survivor.</p>
<h2>Lone survivor</h2>
<p>Could be another bee, or the one that have gotten away, but found it trying to master the art of sailing exploring rope clutch on my mast.  Zap’n’vac!  The zapper I have is only 3000V, and the larger the beast, the sooner it comes back to life.  Hope they won’t hive inside of my vacuum cleaner’s chamber.  I yet have to figure out how to kill them when they’re inside — just making them spin roughens them up a little, but doesn’t exactly kill.  Flying insects are overall really tough dudes.  Not to be fucked with, but can’t let them live rent-free on my boat, sorry nature.</p>
<p>It’s absolutely paramount for everything to be sealed.  If an insect can get in, it will.</p><h1>iPhone</h1>
<p>On my way back from The Waterfront restaurant found an iPhone with cracked back panel laying in the grass next to the road.  Picked it up, the front seemed to be fine.  Good.  Brought it home, put tape on cameras and fingerprint sensor, charged it up, it showed up home screen with a ton of missed calls.  I called "Dad", a guy picked up the phone, I said I found this phone laying on the road and would like to return it.  Will give it back to the family tomorrow.  It’s their daughter’s, they must’ve lost it a day or two ago on the way from their houseboat.  Maybe I’ll be able to rent their dock in case my current plan to anchor not far from here falls through.</p>
<p>The phone is not locked with any sort of passcode or fingerprint/face ID.  I’ve way too much pride to go through their texts, photos, and browsing history, but somebody else would.  And that somebody could be a real evil pedo, finding an iPhone of a 13 year old girl is many men’s wet dream.  No joke.</p><h1>Crashboxes</h1>
<p>The storage compartment on the starboard side has inspection port missing, and I don’t like that a single bit.  There’s basically a round 12cm hole that leads from that storage compartment into the crashbox.  Thankfully the crashbox has no water inside, but it has to be closed ASAP.  I’ll find something light yet waterproof and install them on both port and starboard sides.</p>
<p>The wall itself is honeycomb, about 35mm thick with all the paint and stuff.  I’ll find something nice to make it a real inspection port.  Will use silica bags to absorb all the moisture inside of those crashboxes.  Hope to never ever need to touch those inspection ports again after that.</p>
<p>For the time being I’ve put white polyethylene barrier tape over that hole to make sure nothing crawls in and dies in there.</p>
<p>As for good news, the bow crossbeam seems to be made either out of carbon or aramid-carbon fiber — something black with traces of greenish yellow.  What a nice surprise!</p><h1>The chain</h1>
<p>Pulled out my main anchor's chain.  Appears to be 42' long, rusted through and through.  Need to replace that treasure before I decide to drop the anchor somewhere.  The rest of that rode seems to be dyneema or some other synthetic rope.  It's old but doesn't appear to be damaged, no need to replace that one yet.</p>
<p>Chain links appear to be 5cm long, 3cm wide, and 1cm in diameter.  I hope it's possible to get stainless chain today, this one isn't looking good at all, but then again there's no anchor washdown pump in place, so that might've contributed to its poor condition.</p>
<p>I do have a small bruce style anchor, but no idea how well that will hold me in place, especially during the hurricane season.  Also, pulling those things out by hand is no fun.</p><h1>Wiring the mast up</h1>
<p>My mast is pretty boring right now — nothing lights up, only the bees seem to be enjoying it.</p>
<p>By just looking at it, it seems to have the following electronics on it:</p>
<ul>
<li>spreader lights</li>
<li>wind vane</li>
<li>running lights</li>
<li>antenna</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’re the wires that go from it into my cabin along with the compression post, and then into the engine compartment:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 green</li>
<li>1 yellow</li>
<li>1 white(red stripe)</li>
<li>1 white(black stripe)</li>
<li>1 black coaxial</li>
<li>1 black multi-prong</li>
</ul>
<p>Tho coaxial is obviously for the antenna, the black multi-wire is definitely the Raytheon wind instrument (back in the 90s they didn’t have wireless wind vanes yet), and green/yellow and that other pair of white wires with stripes on them seem to be both for lights.  One is for navigation lights, other is for two lamps on my lower spreader.  Good that I can figure out which one is which by just plugging them in, even polarity doesn’t matter — no way they’re LED.  Interesting how all those wires go into the engine compartment, and then end up in my starboard hull where the instruments and switches are, even though they run behind the compression post inside the cabin prior to that.  Adventurous little wires.  Now I’m gonna do my best tracing them to my circuit breaker panel.</p>
<p>The white(red stripe)/white(black stripe) pair seems to be for foredeck (spreader) lights.  The green/yellow pair seems to be for running lights (navigation).  Both of those pairs get the voltage just fine, the bulbs must be dead (lightning strike?).</p>
<p>Found switch for engine room lights - those were wrongly labeled as "ANCHOR WASHDOWN".  There’s no washdown pump, hence must’ve been something else.  Both navigation lights’ and engine room lights’ wires have yellow color and exact same gauge, both go from the engine room.  Gotta love when everything’s intuitive and makes sense.</p>
<p>Here’s what I now know about wires coming out of the engine room:</p>
<ul>
<li>yellow — (12V+) engine room lights, hooked up to "ANCHOR WASHDOWN", operational</li>
<li>green(white stripe) — (12V+) engine room blowers, goes to "ENGINE ROOM BLOWERS", operational</li>
<li>white(black stripe) — (GND) shared between engine room blowers and engine room lights</li>
<li>green — (GND) running lights</li>
<li>yellow — (12V+) running lights, goes to "RUNNING LIGHTS", non-operational</li>
<li>
<p>white(red stripe) — (12V+) spreader lights, goes to "FOREDECK LIGHTS", non-operational
 <!-- - white(black stripe) - (GND) spreader lights, goes to "ANCHOR LIGHT" for some reason... obviously non-operational --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>white(black stripe) - (GND) spreader lights</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it seems to be that somebody mistakenly wired spreader lights to two separate switches, rather than one to +12V and the other to GND.  I’m gonna try to unfuck this terrible mistake.  If I’m mistaken — it’s been nice knowing y’all.</p>
<p>Nope, nothing.  Dead bulbs?  Both bulbs dead?  Could be, they’re really high up and hard to get to, and the boat’s over 20 years old, hence quite possible.  The resistance is 35KOhm one way, 40MOhm the other... might be LEDs — color me impressed.  Will rewire now and give it another try.</p>
<p>Nothing again.  Time to put this shit to bed, it’s almost 23:00.</p>
<p>On a side note, the current state of wiring on that panel could be best described as dismal.</p><h1>More energy</h1>
<p>While tracing wires from my mast, found a giant gray battery tucked underneath my main battery array.  Seems to be connected.  Could be starter battery for the motor or some other kind of lead-acid treasure.  Will find out later.</p></a></div></div><div><div class="content"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 25.07.2022</h1><a id="davits"></a><h1>Davits</h1>
<p>Used acetone to wipe old paint off the davit system.  The process mostly felt like wiping dust — the UV has made the white paint disintegrate completely.</p>
<p>That whole contraption is aluminum — no idea what grade though.  There's a pretty thick layer of zinc chromate underneath the paint that was used as anti-corrosion barrier, and I have to say it's done its job.  I'd like to sand and repaint the whole thing a little bit later, but for now it no longer stains my skin and clothes on contact, and will serve as a good holder for my tender.</p><a id="radar-pole"></a><h1>Radar pole</h1>
<p>There’s a tall aluminum radar pole located on starboard side, it holds GPS antenna and Raytheon radar.  Both are not in use and more than two decades old, besides I want to have my new B&amp;G radar to be placed on the mast.  Once the Raytheon radar is gone, I plan to use this pole for wind generator.  From aluminum I’ll switch to carbon fiber.  Then I want to take down the existing air generator pole from the port side and mirror the exact same base and carbon pole for my second wind turbine on that side, too, to make it symmetrical.</p>
<p>That pole has caused me a lot of trouble — mostly due to rain getting caught between the hull and the pole, and dripping into my aft compartment where autopilot and black water tank are.  It was a design flaw, so I’ve solved it for now by wrapping that aluminum pole with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08174678F/">white polyethylene barrier tape</a>, that should prevent any moisture from accumulating at its base.</p></div></div><div><div><a href="../../../2022/07/26/" class="content"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 26.07.2022</h1><h1>Letters</h1>
<p>I need to take down "NORTHERN BOUNTY / VANCOUVER CANADA" and put "CURIOUS CAT / LAHAINA HAWAII" on my boat’s stern.  It’s part of that whole USCG compliance shebang that also includes vessel registration number placard, having documents onboard, and a couple other things.</p>
<p>The transom area is 24cm (9.5") tall, davits’ legs hug that area around the center and hence I have to place my vessel’s name and hailing port either inside the space of 100cm (39.5"), right underneath the davit system, or put "CURIOUS CAT" on port side, to the left of davits, and "LAHAINA HAWAII" to the right, on starboard.  Need to check USCG requirements for that.  Currently the vessel and home port names are located in the center, so hopefully letters don’t have to be too big to satisfy the requirements and will fit in there.</p>
<p>This guide states that my letters must be at least 4" inches tall (10.16cm), <em>"can be on the transom or either side of the vessel"</em>, <em>"there is no requirement for block letters or any other restrictions to type, font, or color for federally documented vessels"</em> — that one last is good, I should be able to use font that looks either very round (to match curves of my beautiful chunky cat), or go for pixel font, something like one of my favorites, Visitor TT2 — to match QR Codes that I plan on slapping on the sides of my boat.
Also, this is a bit worrying yet nice at the same time, <em>"When dinghy’s are stored on the swim platform or transom causing the vessel’s name and hailing port to be obscured from view, there is no Federal requirement to place the name and hailing port elsewhere. That is a Law Enforcement issue only"</em>.</p>
<p>Overall all good news, everything will fit under the davits and as long as I keep the dinghy lifted high enough, it shouldn’t cause any issues.</p><h1>Compass lights</h1>
<p>Traced and connected two wires for my compasses’ backlight — green and white(red stripe).</p>
<p>There’re two Ritchie compasses on Curious Cat, one per helm.  They have built-in backlight, or if you can count very dim tiny LED as one.  I hope there’s a way to adjust something and make them brighter.  They might be intentionally dim by design, not to be mistaken for navigation lights, since they’re lime-green.  I’d like to have something brighter, perhaps with built-in photodiode to toggle and adjust its backlight automatically.</p>
<p>There’s currently no switch in the circuit, they’re always-on.  I’ll connect them later to a breaker — there doesn’t seem to be any fuses in the circuit after all.</p>
<p>The compass on my starboard side seems to be either older or just way more damaged by the UV; even with backlight on I can’t see anything at night on that one.</p></a></div></div></div>
