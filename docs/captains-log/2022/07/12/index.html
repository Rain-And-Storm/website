<p>Jim was passing by my boat again today, we chatted for a bit.</p>
<p>Turned out that those long fiberglass planks in my cabin that say "Tektron 44" on them are mainsail battens.  Mystery solved.</p>
<p>He’s recommended coating them in epoxy to make them slide in and out more easily.  I’ll probably do just that.
At least one of them is very good at giving me splinters, so that’s another reason for epoxying right there.</p></a></div></div><div><div><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 12.07.2022</h1><h1>Keelcrab</h1>
<p>The tide was high this afternoon, so I gave my Keelcrab a try.</p>
<p>Installed metal brushes to get rid of barnacles, connected everything up, and the thing chooched!
My cat's hull is extremely round, so it was very hard to keep the crab "glued" to it, but I've managed to clean part of my port hull.  Wish the water here was less muddy, instead more clear and blue like in Hawaii — it's really hard to see where that little robot is, and even its camera can't see far in that nasty brown water.</p>
<p>Later it turned out that I removed some kind of foam flotation devices from Keelcrab because I, of course, didn't read the fucking manual and thought those were there to prevent something from breaking during transportation.  In my defense, they looked ghetto af.  I'll put them back in and give it another try sometime soon.</p></div></div><div><div><a href="../../../2022/07/13/"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 13.07.2022</h1><h1>USCG documentation</h1>
<p>Turned out to be that documentation for my vessel won't be mailed for at least four more weeks.  Another thing to delaying me, but it's okay, it's all part of it.</p>
<p>Long story short is that the USCG have changed their forms at the end of April, and my paperwork was submitted right before then, so they had to re-fill and re-submit everything.  Bad ~~timing~~ luck.  Despite my boat being in the registry, I have no papers on hand that prove that I own the vessel, ergo unlikely to be able to pass through the Panama Canal until I get my papers together, but we'll see.</p>
<p>Will likely have to ask UPS to forward me those papers from Hawaii to wherever I'm gonna be at in 4+ weeks.</p></a></div></div></div>
