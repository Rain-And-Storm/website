<p>A beautiful hydrogen/wind/solar/electric catamaran.
The main idea behind this unique vessel is to combine various sources of energy to propel electric motors,
to always be able to move.
My main object of interest is dual-faced solar panels.</p>
<p>Solar array output: 34 kWp</p>

<p><img alt="Tûranor PlanetSolar" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/turanor-planetsolar/turanor-planetsolar-main.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Tûranor PlanetSolar</h2>
<p>The largest solar-powered boat in the world.
Launched in 2010, this catamaran is 102' long.
Built by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft and designed by LOMOcean Marine.
The vessel is a giant floating solar panel, and I hope to get one day a chance to see her with my own eyes.
<a href="https://www.bluebird-electric.net/planetsolar.htm">Here</a>’s more information.</p>
<p>Solar array output: 93.5 kWp</p>

<h2>Silent Yacht</h2>
<p><img alt="Silent 62" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/silent-yacht/silent-yacht-main.webp" /></p>
<p>These luxury electric power cats need no introduction.
The main point of my interest in them is their massive photovoltaic system that theoretically allows infinite cruising range given enough sunlight.
Achieving that is one of the main goals that Curious Cat has.</p>
<p>Solar array output: 16.8 kWp</p>

<h2>Indigo Lady</h2>
<p><img alt="Indigo Lady main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/indigo-lady/indigo-lady-main.jpg" /><img alt="Indigo Lady rails photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/indigo-lady/indigo-lady-rails.jpg" /></p>
<p>A sailing charter cat that was transformed into a “Silent Yacht”.
Uses superb Super-B batteries, OceanVolt propulsion.
I'm borrowing the idea of splitting the solar panels into two sections (port &amp; starboard),
since Curious Cat’s beam is 30', and I don't want the whole roof to fly away next time she goes through a storm.</p>
<p>Solar array output: 7.2 kWp</p>

<h2>MODX 70</h2>
<p><img alt="MODX 70 main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/modx-70/modx-70-main.jpg" /></p>
<p>Very new concept, lots of great architectural and engineering decisions.
Wing sails, electric propulsion.</p>
<p>Solar array output: 15 kWp</p>

<h2>Ya — 2015 custom fossil-free monohull sailboat</h2>
<p><img alt="Ya main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/ya/ya-main.jpg" /><img alt="Ya side photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/ya/ya-side.jpg" /></p>
<p>Built out of vinylester, equipped with two electric motors.
This is what I want to do with my boat, the way I want Curious Cat to be: green, sustainable, free.
More info is available on <a href="https://fossilfreearoundtheworld.org">their website</a>.</p>
<p>Solar array output: 1.2 kWp</p>

<h2>TAG 60</h2>
<p><img alt="TAG 60 main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/tag-60/tag-60-main.jpg" /></p>

## Siva — 2012 Schionning Spirited 380

![Siva main photo](../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/siva/siva-main.jpg)

Equally beautiful inside and out.
I really like the clean tidy interior this 38' Australian daggerboard cat has.
On one of the pictures I spotted a strange shiny thing on the wall, that was a compact wall-mounted washer/dryer by Daewoo.
Now, thanks to wonders of capitalism, Curious Cat has a washing machine aboard!

<h2>Green eMotion — 2010 African Cats GreenCat 445</h2>
<p><img alt="Green eMotion African Cats GreenCat 445 main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/green-emotion-african-cats-greencat-445/green-emotion-african-cats-greencat-445-main.jpg" /><img alt="Green eMotion African Cats GreenCat 445 propulsion system photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/green-emotion-african-cats-greencat-445/green-emotion-african-cats-greencat-445-propulsion-system.jpg" /><img alt="Green eMotion African Cats GreenCat 445 cockpit photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/green-emotion-african-cats-greencat-445/green-emotion-african-cats-greencat-445-cockpit.jpg" /></p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to discover this rare and special 43' catamaran.
She was a bit out of my budget, but already electric, built out of best materials on the market, looking incredibly beautiful on the inside, and equipped with unique retractable propulsion system that can be lifted completely out of the water when not in use — as all propulsion systems on sailboats should be, in my humble opinion.
Both bottom and top parts of this vessel are built as one piece (monocoque construction), which makes it stronger and lighter — a feature only Seawind and couple other makers are known for.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Blue Saga — 2018 LUNA 47</h2>
<p><img alt="Blue Saga main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/blue-saga/blue-saga-main.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is a high-end 47' sailing liveaboard catamaran that incorporates many interesting modern technologoies.
Videos made by her owners served as great help in my research.
All-electric propulsion, MacGlide environmentally-friendly antifouling sticker, flush port windows and hatches — those are the things that I imagined having on my dream boat.
More info can be found on <a href="https://www.thebluesaga.com/">this beautiful website</a>.</p>

<h2>Kawaakari — 2013 Erik Lerouge 137</h2>
<p><img alt="Kawaakari Erik Lerouge 137 main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/kawaakari-erik-lerouge-137/kawaakari-erik-lerouge-137-main.jpg" /><img alt="Kawaakari Erik Lerouge 137 night photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/kawaakari-erik-lerouge-137/kawaakari-erik-lerouge-137-at-night.jpg" /></p>
<p>An absolute stunner, this magnificent 45' vessel is a carbon kevlar daggerboard cat capable of sailing at 26 knots!
Early in my search I was looking strictly for Erik Lerouge designs — that’s how much I like them.</p>
<hr />
<h2>MAXI JAZZ — 2010 Feral 50</h2>
<p><img alt="MAXI JAZZ Feral 50 main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/maxi-jazz-feral-50/maxi-jazz-feral-50-main.jpg" /><img alt="MAXI JAZZ Feral 50 cabin photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/maxi-jazz-feral-50/maxi-jazz-feral-50-cabin.jpg" /><img alt="MAXI JAZZ Feral 50 salon photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/maxi-jazz-feral-50/maxi-jazz-feral-50-salon.jpg" /></p>
<p>Custom-made one-of-a-kind composite 50' performance cruising catamaran built by Waikato Marine Composites in New Zealand.
Designed by Nic Bailey.
The construction is carbon fiber kevlar vacuumed hull with incredibly beautiful lines inside and out.
Both the interior and body somehow remind me of a flying saucer.
Painted with Atlex Elite Polyurethane, this is one of the vessels I look up to, a real masterpiece.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Shooting Star — 2007 Morrelli &amp; Melvin</h2>
<p><img alt="Shooting Star Morrelli &amp; Melvin main photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/shooting-star-morrelli-and-melvin/shooting-star-morrelli-and-melvin-main.jpg" /><img alt="Shooting Star Morrelli &amp; Melvin cabin photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/shooting-star-morrelli-and-melvin/shooting-star-morrelli-and-melvin-cabin.jpg" /><img alt="Shooting Star Morrelli &amp; Melvin side photo" src="../../assets/curious-cat/inspirations/shooting-star-morrelli-and-melvin/shooting-star-morrelli-and-melvin-side.jpg" /></p>
<p>Custom one-of-a-kind all-carbon 50' luxury cruising catamaran built by Morrelli &amp; Melvin.
Early inspiration for Gunboats, this beauty is strong, light, and lets you sail while being protected from nasty wind and water.
I wish there were more cats in the world like this masterpiece.</p>
