<p>My E-Tech motors came with beefy rigid couplings.  They’re not stainless but very well made.</p>
<p>I’m having a very bad feeling attaching 50kg motors to my 30mm prop shafts using those.  Long story short is I feel that using something like Combiflex by Vetus instead would allow me to reduce noise and vibration, plus prevent subtle movements of my motors from possibly bending the shaft, damaging shaft bearings, or wearing out its own internals.  The motors are going to be mounted on antivibration engine mountings that will let them swing a little bit.  It only makes sense to use flexible couplings here, my cat is a sailboat after all.</p>
<p>The prop shaft is 30mm in diameter, the motor’s shaft is 35mm with 8mm key.  I’ll have to design and custom-manufacture flanges that go along with those Combiflex couplings, but once that’s done the connection will be as close to perfect as it can be.</p></a></div></div><div><div><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 16.07.2022</h1><h1>Balls</h1>
<p>Measured tracks on my boat.  Three out of five of them are currently out of commission.  All seem to be by Lewmar.  The car for the mainsail looks like a custom-made one from their Ocean series — the line that’s phased out, but still possible to find spare parts for, so big ❤️ for that to Lewmar!</p>
<p>For some unknown reason found Harken kit for reballing their cars (HBB197).  Tracks in the cockpit could be by Harken, but I think somebody just plainly fucked up.  Torlon® balls are a bit exy, about $1.5/piece, and Lewmar seems to be selling them in packs of 100.  Luckily, found 58 of them aboard, and about the same amount of Harken’s 10mm balls from that kit.  Harken are a bit bigger, 9.56mm (3/8") while Lewmar’s appear to be 9.5mm exact (Size 3).  Have nothing against Harken, just don’t want to have anything but Lewmar on my boat, and don’t think it’s a good idea to attempt stuffing 9.56mm balls into Lewmar car meant to run on 9.5mm, no need to cut corners, literally.</p>
<p>Can’t find cars for tracks in the cockpit, will likely have to buy those.  I like Lewmar’s new cars, they’re black.</p></div></div><div><div></div></div></div>
