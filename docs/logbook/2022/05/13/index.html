<p>Reached out to Northern Composites today.  It’s a company that I was referred to by a contact at SGS when I asked for help regarding identifying materials that were used to build the hull of my vessel.
It’s obviously mostly kevlar, but the resin type is not clear.  Since the boat was reposessed twice (so far), the blueprints and all other info is missing.  SGS will help me with gas/mass spectrometry to see if it’s vinyl ester or really epoxy resin.  But NC are hopefully going to be there to help me with everything else (choice of materials for repairs, and just answer small questions here and there).</p><h1>Chisel</h1>
<p>Ordered a set of Japanese chisels off Amazon today.
Becase using my oscillating tool to remove all the wooden planks is going to take months.
It’s ridiculous that I have to use a chisel and hammer on a composite boat, but I’m not the one who glued those wooden planks there to hold ugly dusty lining that has mostly disintegrated after over two decades under UV.  </p></a></div></div><div><div><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 13.05.2022</h1><h1>I am what I create</h1>
<p>Original owner of the land where I’m renting the dock came by today with her son.
Very nice people, glad I got to meet Val.
I felt bad my I couldn’t invite them to check it out — my boat is right now a real mess on the inside.  But who isn’t.
Lots of splinters, saw dust, and trash bags full of whatever I’m not interested keeping.</p>
<p>It was nice of her to ask permission to pass my contact info to the new owners; they’re willing to continue renting the dock out to me.
No wonder, it’s $44/day of passive income, who would say "no" to that.</p>
<p>Her son runs the restaurant.
He had a really cool tattoo on his right arm — a purple square with "I am what I create" written in Hebrew.</p></div></div><div><div><a href="../../../2022/07/05/"><h1>Captain’s log<br />Dateline: 05.07.2022</h1><h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
<p>Happy Birthday, my little cat!  You’re only 24 today, and the journey is just beginning for you.  I’m extremely lucky to have you in my life, and I enjoy taking care of you very-very much.  Wish I could hug you, but you’re way too big.</p></a></div></div></div>
