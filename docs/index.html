<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>Built in Canada by TEK-composites Inc. and launched on July 5 1998 under its original name "Northern Bounty", this is the only TEK-45 (AKA Tektron 44) ever built.
Waffle weave kevlar foam core epoxy shell with a beam of 30' at 44' long.  This boat is a love child of TEK-35 and Tektron 50, the latter being at one point one of the fastest multihulls in the world.  TEK-composites Inc. was a subsidiary of Tektron Equipment Corporation formed in 1986 that mostly manufactured airplane and helicopter hulls, producing only 15 boats in total during its life span.
Those included first 3 legendary Manta catamarans that later were sold to US investors and became US-made cats.</p>
<p>Originally purchased for $1M by 3 couples that took her on a one year sailing trip, she ended up being a slip queen for over 20 years on Gulf Coast of Florida near St. James City.
After being reposessed twice and going through many owners while remaining still at the very same spot, she now belongs to yours truly as of March '22.</p>
<p>It is a performance cruising catamaran.
It's a shame a boat like this one has not been used at all in two decades, she's got a lot of life left in her and deserves much more than sitting dead in the water.</p>
<h2>New name</h2>
<p>I didn't like the original name so gave her a new one: Curious Cat.
Let's see how many lives she's got left.
I believe that names of catamarans should ideally be feline, she's a cat after all.
My other naming options were:</p>
<p><code>Catanic
Catbus
Stimpy
Stifler's Mom
Purr Some Sugar On Me
Stormy
Sunshine
Octocat
Kittana
Catharsis
Cataclysmic Apawcalypse
Purrfect Apawcalypse
Catfish
Purr Pressure
Fat Cat
Win-win
Catch-44
Purr Purr
Double Trouble
