<h2>About</h2>
<p>Welcome to personal website of Curious Cat, an electric sailing catamaran set to travel around the world while logging its fantastic adventures.</p>
<h2>Vessel’s origin</h2>
<p>Built in Canada by TEK-composites Inc. and launched on July 5th of 1998 under her original name “Northern Bounty”, she is the only TEK-45 AKA Tektron 44 ever built.
This boat is a love child of TEK-35 and Tektron 50, both <a href="https://www.shuttleworthdesign.com">John Shuttleworth</a>’s designs, and the latter being at one point one of the fastest multihulls in the world.  TEK-composites Inc. was a subsidiary of Tektron Equipment Corporation formed in 1986.  The company mostly manufactured airplane and helicopter hulls, producing only fifteen boats in total during its lifetime.  Those included first three legendary Manta catamarans that later were sold to American investors and became USA-made cats.</p>
<p>Originally purchased for $1M by three Canadian couples that took her on a one-year sailing trip, she ended up being a slip queen for over 20 years on the Gulf Coast of Florida near Saint James City.
After getting reposessed twice and going through many owners while remaining at the very same spot, she now belongs to yours truly as of March ’22.</p>
<p>She is a very spacious performance cruising catamaran built out of composite materials.  It’s a shame a boat like this was not used at all in two decades, she’s got a lot of life left in her and deserves much more than sitting dead in the water.  But new adventure awaits her, let’s see where wind and and current take her now!</p>
